<meta name="citation_abstract" content="For decades, fMRI analysis has predominantly focused on linear relationships, such as simple signal magnitude changes and pair-wise functional connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that failing to account for the brain&amp;amp;#039;s non-linear, dynamic organization may lead to incomplete inferences about neural processes. More recently,  cognitive and clinical neuroimaging have begun to draw on tools from complexity science to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. Temporal complexity metrics reflect a range of approaches to complexity in time series, including describing the system's regularity and irregularity, predictability and unpredictability, information compressibility, long-term memory, and fractal patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), applications of temporal complexity are scattered across siloed literatures with varying clarity, which limits accessibility and therefore popularity. This review aims to bridge this gap by communicating the basics of temporal complexity to fMRI scientists. We offer a comprehensive guide to temporal complexity in fMRI, including an overview of fMRI temporal complexity metrics—Shannon entropy, variations of (multi-scale) sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, avalanche measures, and Hurst—followed by a comprehensive review of extant applications in fMRI.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Resilient, Low-Frequency, Small-World Human Brain Functional Network with Highly Connected Association Cortical Hubs;,citation_abstract=Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks. Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03–0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing.;,citation_author=Sophie Achard;,citation_author=Raymond Salvador;,citation_author=Brandon Whitcher;,citation_author=John Suckling;,citation_author=Ed Bullmore;,citation_publication_date=2006-01;,citation_cover_date=2006-01;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3874-05.2006;,citation_issn=0270-6474, 1529-2401;,citation_pmid=16399673;,citation_volume=26;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Neuroscience;,citation_publisher=Society for Neuroscience;">

Complexity analysis of functional brain structure data represents a new multidisciplinary approach to examining complex, living structures. I aimed to construct a connectivity map of visual brain activities using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and to characterize the level of complexity of functional brain activity using these connectivity data. Methods . A total of 25 healthy controls and 20 patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated. fMRI preprocessing analysis was performed that included head motion correction, temporal filtering, and spatial smoothing process. Brain entropy (BEN) was calculated using the Shannon entropy equation. Results . My findings demonstrated that patients exhibited reduced brain complexity in visual brain areas compared to controls. The mean entropy value of the ADHD group was 0.56  0.14 , compared to 0.64  0.11 in the control group. Conclusion . My study adds an important novel result to the growing literature pertaining to abnormal visual processing in ADHD that my ADHD patients had lower BEN values, indicating more-regular functional brain structure and abnormal visual information processing.;,citation_author=Gülsüm Akdeniz;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1155/2017/3091815;,citation_issn=1687-5265, 1687-5273;,citation_volume=2017;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain network entropy, depression, and quality of life in people with traumatic brain injury and seizure disorders;,citation_abstract=Abstract Objective Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often precedes the onset of epileptic (ES) or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) with depression being a common comorbidity. The relationship between depression severity and quality of life (QOL) may be related to resting-state network complexity. We investigated these relationships in adults with TBI-only, TBI + ES, or TBI + PNES using Sample Entropy (SampEn), a measure of physiologic signals complexity. Methods Adults with TBI-only ( n  = 60), TBI + ES ( n  = 21), or TBI + PNES ( n  = 56) completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; depression symptom severity) and QOL in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) assessments and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). SampEn values derived from six resting state functional networks were calculated per participant. Effects of group, network, and group-by-network-interactions for SampEn were investigated with a mixed-effects model. We examined relationships between BDI-II, QOL, and SampEn of each of the networks. Results Groups did not differ in age, but there was a higher proportion of women with TBI + PNES ( p  = 0.040). TBI + ES and TBI-only groups did not differ in BDI-II or QOLIE-31 scores, while the TBI + PNES group scored worse on both measures. The fixed effects of the model revealed significant differences in SampEn values across networks (lower SampEn for the frontoparietal network compared to other networks). The likelihood ratio test for group-by-network-interactions was significant ( p  = 0.033). BDI-II was significantly negatively associated with Overall QOL scale scores in all groups, and significantly negatively associated with network SampEn values only in the TBI + PNES group. Significance Only TBI + PNES had significant relationships between depression symptom severity and network SampEn values indicating that the resting state network complexity is related to depression severity in this group but not in TBI + ES or TBI-only. Plain Language Summary The brain has a complex network of internal connections. How well these connections work may be affected by TBI and seizures and may underlie mental health symptoms including depression; the worse the depression, the worse the quality of life. Our study compared brain organization in people with TBI, people with epilepsy after TBI, and people with nonepileptic seizures after TBI. Only people with nonepileptic seizures after TBI showed a relationship between how organized their brain connections were and how bad was their depression. We need to better understand these relationships to develop more impactful, effective treatments.;,citation_author=Jane B. Allendorfer;,citation_author=Rodolphe Nenert;,citation_author=Adam M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Temporal Characteristics of Audiovisual Information Processing;,citation_abstract=In complex natural environments, auditory and visual information often have to be processed simultaneously. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies focused on the spatial localization of brain areas involved in audiovisual (AV) information processing, but the temporal characteristics of AV information flow in these regions remained unclear. In this study, we used fMRI and a novel information–theoretic approach to study the flow of AV sensory information. Subjects passively perceived sounds and images of objects presented either alone or simultaneously. Applying the measure of mutual information, we computed for each voxel the latency in which the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal had the highest information content about the preceding stimulus. The results indicate that, after AV stimulation, the earliest informative activity occurs in right Heschl’s gyrus, left primary visual cortex, and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, which is known as a region involved in object-related AV integration. Informative activity in the anterior portion of superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, right occipital cortex, and inferior frontal cortex was found at a later latency. Moreover, AV presentation resulted in shorter latencies in multiple cortical areas compared with isolated auditory or visual presentation. The results provide evidence for bottom-up processing from primary sensory areas into higher association areas during AV integration in humans and suggest that AV presentation shortens processing time in early sensory cortices.;,citation_author=Galit Fuhrmann Alpert;,citation_author=Grit Hein;,citation_author=Nancy Tsai;,citation_author=Marcus J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unveiling universal aspects of the cellular anatomy of the brain;,citation_abstract=Abstract Recent cellular-level volumetric brain reconstructions have revealed high levels of anatomic complexity. Determining which structural aspects of the brain to focus on, especially when comparing with computational models and other organisms, remains a major challenge. Here we quantify aspects of this complexity and show evidence that brain anatomy satisfies universal scaling laws, establishing the notion of structural criticality in the cellular structure of the brain. Our framework builds upon understanding of critical systems to provide clear guidance in selecting informative structural properties of cellular brain anatomy. As an illustration, we obtain estimates for critical exponents in the human, mouse and fruit fly brains and show that they are consistent between organisms, to the extent that data limitations allow. Such universal quantities are robust to many of the microscopic details of the cellular structures of individual brains, providing a key step towards generative computational models of the cellular structure of the brain, and also clarifying in which sense one animal may be a suitable anatomic model for another.;,citation_author=Helen S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The biological role of local and global fMRI BOLD signal variability in human brain organization;,citation_abstract=Abstract Variability drives the organization and behavior of complex systems, including the human brain. Understanding the variability of brain signals is thus necessary to broaden our window into brain function and behavior. Few empirical investigations of macroscale brain signal variability have yet been undertaken, given the difficulty in separating biological sources of variance from artefactual noise. Here, we characterize the temporal variability of the most predominant macroscale brain signal, the fMRI BOLD signal, and systematically investigate its statistical, topographical and neurobiological properties. We contrast fMRI acquisition protocols, and integrate across histology, microstructure, transcriptomics, neurotransmitter receptor and metabolic data, fMRI static connectivity, and empirical and simulated magnetoencephalography data. We show that BOLD signal variability represents a spatially heterogeneous, central property of multi-scale multi-modal brain organization, distinct from noise. Our work establishes the biological relevance of BOLD signal variability and provides a lens on brain stochasticity across spatial and temporal scales.;,citation_author=Giulia Baracchini;,citation_author=Yigu Zhou;,citation_author=Jason Da Silva Castanheira;,citation_author=Justine Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=BOLD temporal variability differentiates wakefulness from anesthesia-induced unconsciousness;,citation_abstract=Even though a number of findings, based on information content or information integration, are shown to define neural underpinnings characteristic of a conscious experience, the neurophysiological mechanism of consciousness is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the brain activity and functional connectivity changes that occur in the isoflurane-anesthetized unconscious state in contrast to the awake state in rats (awake and/or anesthetized, n = 68 rats). We examined nine information measures previously shown to distinguish between conscious states: blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) variability, functional connectivity strength, modularity, weighted modularity, efficiency, clustering coefficient, small-worldness, and spatial and temporal Lempel-Ziv complexity measure. We also identified modular membership, seed-based network connectivity, and absolute and normalized power spectrums to assess the integrity of the BOLD functional networks between awake and anesthesia. fMRI BOLD variability and related absolute power were the only information measures significantly higher during the awake state compared with isoflurane anesthesia across animals, and with varying levels of anesthesia, after correcting for motion and respiration confounds. Thus, we conclude that, at least under the specific conditions examined here, global measures of information integration/sharing do not properly distinguish the anesthetized state from wakefulness, and heightened overall, global and local, BOLD variability is the most reliable determinant of conscious brain activity relative to isoflurane anesthesia. NEW &amp;amp;amp; NOTEWORTHY Multiple metrics previously suggested to be able to distinguish between states of consciousness were compared, within and across rats in awake and isoflurane anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. All measures tested showed sensitivity to confounds, correcting for motion and for respiration changes due to anesthesia. Resting state local BOLD variability and the related absolute power were the only information measures that robustly differentiated wakefulness states. These results caution against the general applicability of global information measures in identifying levels of consciousness, thus challenging the popular concept that these measures reflect states of consciousness, and also pointing to local signal variability as a more reliable indicator of states of wakefulness.;,citation_author=Alexis T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neuronal Avalanches in Neocortical Circuits;,citation_abstract=Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that “neuronal avalanches” may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.;,citation_author=John M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Selective Participation of Single Cortical Neurons in Neuronal Avalanches;,citation_abstract=Neuronal avalanches are scale-invariant neuronal population activity patterns in the cortex that emerge in vivo in the awake state and in vitro during balanced excitation and inhibition. Theory and experiments suggest that avalanches indicate a state of cortex that improves numerous aspects of information processing by allowing for the transient and selective formation of local as well as system-wide spanning neuronal groups. If avalanches are indeed involved with information processing, one might expect that single neurons would participate in avalanche patterns selectively. Alternatively, all neurons could participate proportionally to their own activity in each avalanche as would be expected for a population rate code. Distinguishing these hypotheses, however, has been difficult as robust avalanche analysis requires technically challenging measures of their intricate organization in space and time at the population level, while also recording sub- or suprathreshold activity from individual neurons with high temporal resolution. Here, we identify repeated avalanches in the ongoing local field potential (LFP) measured with high-density microelectrode arrays in the cortex of awake nonhuman primates and in acute cortex slices from young and adult rats. We studied extracellular unit firing in vivo and intracellular responses of pyramidal neurons in vitro . We found that single neurons participate selectively in specific LFP-based avalanche patterns. Furthermore, we show in vitro that manipulating the balance of excitation and inhibition abolishes this selectivity. Our results support the view that avalanches represent the selective, scale-invariant formation of neuronal groups in line with the idea of Hebbian cell assemblies underlying cortical information processing.;,citation_author=Timothy Bellay;,citation_author=Woodrow L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Markers of criticality in phase synchronization;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$The concept of the brain as a critical dynamical system is very attractive because systems close to criticality are thought to maximize their dynamic range of information processing and communication. To date, there have been two key experimental observations in support of this hypothesis: (i) neuronal avalanches with power law distribution of size and (ii) long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these maximize dynamic range of information processing and communication is still being made and because a significant substrate for information coding and transmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronization measures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterizing criticality in synchronization based on an analysis of the moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase synchrony in terms of the presence of LRTCs. This framework relies on an estimation of the rate of change of phase difference and a set of methods we have developed to detect LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of criticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these models aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these simulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of LRTCs in phase synchronization. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing pairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of corticomuscular phase synchronization can be detected in the resting state and experimentally manipulated. The existence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronization suggests that these fluctuations are governed by non-local behavior, with all scales contributing to system behavior. This has important implications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see LRTCs in phase synchronization. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit LRTCs reflecting a state of readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts toward and away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Maria Botcharova;,citation_author=Simon F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Approximate Entropy as an Electroencephalographic Measure of Anesthetic Drug Effect during Desflurane Anesthesia;,citation_abstract=Background The authors hypothesized that the electroencephalogram (EEG) during higher anesthetic concentrations would show more &amp;amp;amp;quot;order&amp;quot; and less &quot;randomness&quot; than at lower anesthetic concentrations. &quot;Approximate entropy&quot; is a new statistical parameter derived from the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy formula which quantifies the amount of regularity in data. The approximate entropy quantifies the predictability of subsequent amplitude values of the EEG based on the knowledge of the previous amplitude values. The authors investigated the dose-response relation of the EEG approximate entropy during desflurane anesthesia in comparison with spectral edge frequency 95, median frequency, and bispectral index. Methods Twelve female patients were studied during gynecologic laparotomies. Between opening and closure of the peritoneum, end-tidal desflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The EEG approximate entropy, median EEG frequency, spectral edge frequency 95, and bispectral index were determined and the performance of each to predict the desflurane effect compartment concentration, obtained by simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, was compared. Results Electroencephalogram approximate entropy decreased continuously over the observed concentration range of desflurane. The performance of the approximate entropy (prediction probability PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) as an indicator for desflurane concentrations is similar to spectral edge frequency 95 (PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) and bispectral index (PK = 0.82 +/- 0.06) and is statistically significantly better than median frequency (PK = 0.78 +/- 0.06).

The purpose of this study is to characterize task-induced regional BEN alterations using the large Human Connectome Project (HCP) data. To control the potential modulation by the block design, BEN of task-fMRI was calculated from the fMRI images acquired during the task conditions only (task BEN) and then compared to BEN of rs-fMRI (resting BEN). Moreover, BEN was separately calculated from the control blocks of the task-fMRI runs (control BEN) and compared to task BEN. Finally, control BEN was compared to resting BEN to test for residual task effects in the control condition. With respect to resting state, task performance unanimously induced BEN reduction in the peripheral cortical area and BEN increase in the centric part of the sensorimotor and perception networks. Control compared to resting BEN showed similar entropy alterations, suggesting large residual task effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fractal-Based Analysis of fMRI BOLD Signal During Naturalistic Viewing Conditions;,citation_abstract=Background: Temporal fractals are characterized by prominent scale-invariance and self-similarity across time scales. Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions. Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46  3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest. Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279  10 -7 ; 95% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states that occurs during naturalistic processing, and are markedly different than dynamics observed during conventional tasks.;,citation_author=Olivia Campbell;,citation_author=Tamara Vanderwal;,citation_author=Alexander Mark Weber;,citation_publication_date=2022-01;,citation_cover_date=2022-01;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3389/fphys.2021.809943;,citation_issn=1664-042X;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Physiology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monofractal analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging: An introductory review;,citation_abstract=Abstract The following review will aid readers in providing an overview of scale-free dynamics and monofractal analysis, as well as its applications and potential in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroscience and clinical research. Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale-invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale-invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation in the signal may mediate brain functions. This review presents a brief overview of the theory of fMRI monofractal analysis followed by notable findings in the field. Through highlighting the advantages and challenges of the technique, the article provides insight into how to best conduct fMRI fractal analysis and properly interpret the findings with physiological relevance. Furthermore, we identify the future directions necessary for its progression towards impactful functional neuroscience discoveries and widespread clinical use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Canalization and plasticity in psychopathology;,citation_abstract=This theoretical article revives a classical bridging construct, canalization, to describe a new model of a general factor of psychopathology. To achieve this, we have distinguished between two types of plasticity, an early one that we call “TEMP” for “Temperature or Entropy Mediated Plasticity”, and another, we call “canalization”, which is close to Hebbian plasticity. These two forms of plasticity can be most easily distinguished by their relationship to “precision” or inverse variance; TEMP relates to increased model variance or decreased precision, whereas the opposite is true for canalization. TEMP also subsumes increased learning rate, (Ising) temperature and entropy. Dictionary definitions of “plasticity” describe it as the property of being easily shaped or molded; TEMP is the better match for this. Importantly, we propose that “pathological” phenotypes develop via mechanisms of canalization or increased model precision, as a defensive response to adversity and associated distress or dysphoria. Our model states that canalization entrenches in psychopathology, narrowing the phenotypic state-space as the agent develops expertise in their pathology. We suggest that TEMP – combined with gently guiding psychological support – can counter canalization. We address questions of whether and when canalization is adaptive versus maladaptive, furnish our model with references to basic and human neuroscience, and offer concrete experiments and measures to test its main hypotheses and implications.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Intrinsic Hierarchy of Self – Converging Topography and Dynamics;,citation_abstract=Abstract The brain can be characterized by an intrinsic hierarchy in its topography which, as recently shown for the uni-transmodal distinction of core and periphery, converges with its dynamics. Does such intrinsic hierarchical organization in both topography and dynamic also apply to the brain’s inner core itself and its higher-order cognitive functions like self? Applying multiple fMRI data sets, we show how the recently established three-layer topography of self (internal, external, mental) is already present during the resting state and carried over to task states including both task-specific and -unspecific effects. Moreover, the topographic hierarchy converges with corresponding dynamic changes (measured by power-law exponent, autocorrelation window, median frequency, sample entropy, complexity) during both rest and task states. Finally, analogous to the topographic hierarchy, we also demonstrate hierarchy among the different dynamic measures themselves according to background and foreground. Finally, we show task-specific- and un-specific effects in the hierarchies of both dynamics and topography. Together, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic topographic hierarchy of self and its convergence with dynamics.;,citation_author=Yasir Çatal;,citation_author=Mehmet Akif Günay;,citation_author=Chunbo Li;,citation_author=Jijun Wang;,citation_author=Huiru Cui;,citation_author=Wei Li;,citation_author=Georg Northoff;,citation_publication_date=2022-06;,citation_cover_date=2022-06;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1101/2022.06.23.497287;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Neuroscience;">

The purpose of this study was to examine whether BEN is sensitive to pharmaceutical modulations with caffeine. Both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and resting fMRI were collected from sixty caffeine-naïve healthy subjects before and after taking a 200 mg caffeine pill. Our data showed that caffeine reduced CBF in the whole brain but increased BEN across the cerebral cortex with the highest increase in lateral prefrontal cortex, the default mode network (DMN), visual cortex, and motor network, consistent with the beneficial effects of caffeine (such as vigilance and attention) on these areas.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compression in Working Memory and Its Relationship With Fluid Intelligence;,citation_abstract=Abstract Working memory has been shown to be strongly related to fluid intelligence; however, our goal is to shed further light on the process of information compression in working memory as a determining factor of fluid intelligence. Our main hypothesis was that compression in working memory is an excellent indicator for studying the relationship between working-memory capacity and fluid intelligence because both depend on the optimization of storage capacity. Compressibility of memoranda was estimated using an algorithmic complexity metric. The results showed that compressibility can be used to predict working-memory performance and that fluid intelligence is well predicted by the ability to compress information. We conclude that the ability to compress information in working memory is the reason why both manipulation and retention of information are linked to intelligence. This result offers a new concept of intelligence based on the idea that compression and intelligence are equivalent problems.;,citation_author=Mustapha Chekaf;,citation_author=Nicolas Gauvrit;,citation_author=Alessandro Guida;,citation_author=Fabien Mathy;,citation_publication_date=2018-06;,citation_cover_date=2018-06;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=S3;,citation_doi=10.1111/cogs.12601;,citation_issn=0364-0213, 1551-6709;,citation_volume=42;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Cognitive Science;">

This prospective longitudinal study enrolled women age $\geq$ 65 years of age who were breast cancer survivors after exposure to chemotherapy (CH), age-matched survivors not exposed to chemotherapy, and healthy controls. Participants completed resting-state functional brain MRI and neurocognitive testing upon enrollment (timepoint 1, TP1) and again two years later (timepoint 2, TP2). There were 20 participants in each of the three groups at TP1. The CH group showed a significant decrease in SDBOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal variability in standard deviation) in the right middle occipital gyrus ($\Delta$SDBOLD = -0.0018, p = 0.0085, q (pFDR) = 0.043 at MNI (42, -76, 17)) and right middle temporal gyrus ($\Delta$SDBOLD = -0.0021, p = 0.0006, q (pFDR) = 0.001 at MNI (63, -39, -12)).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Synergy and Redundancy in Dual Decompositions of Mutual Information Gain and Information Loss;,citation_abstract=Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information decomposition, based on the construction of information gain lattices, which allows separating the information that a set of variables contains about another variable into components, interpretable as the unique information of one variable, or redundant and synergy components. In this work, we extend this framework focusing on the lattices that underpin the decomposition. We generalize the type of constructible lattices and examine the relations between different lattices, for example, relating bivariate and trivariate decompositions. We point out that, in information gain lattices, redundancy components are invariant across decompositions, but unique and synergy components are decomposition-dependent. Exploiting the connection between different lattices, we propose a procedure to construct, in the general multivariate case, information gain decompositions from measures of synergy or unique information. We then introduce an alternative type of lattices, information loss lattices, with the role and invariance properties of redundancy and synergy components reversed with respect to gain lattices, and which provide an alternative procedure to build multivariate decompositions. We finally show how information gain and information loss dual lattices lead to a self-consistent unique decomposition, which allows a deeper understanding of the origin and meaning of synergy and redundancy.;,citation_author=Daniel Chicharro;,citation_author=Stefano Panzeri;,citation_publication_date=2017-02;,citation_cover_date=2017-02;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.3390/e19020071;,citation_issn=1099-4300;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Entropy;,citation_publisher=Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Distinct Developmental Patterns of Brain Complexity in Autism: A Cross-Sectional Cohort Analysis Using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange;,citation_abstract=Aim Autistic traits exhibit neurodiversity with varying behaviors across developmental stages. Brain complexity theory, illustrating the dynamics of neural activity, may elucidate the evolution of autistic traits over time. Our study explored the patterns of brain complexity in autistic individuals from childhood to adulthood. Methods We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 1087 autistic participants and neurotypical controls aged 6 to 30 years within the ABIDE I (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) data set. Sample entropy was calculated to measure brain complexity among 90 brain regions, utilizing an automated anatomical labeling template for voxel parcellation. Participants were grouped using sliding age windows with partial overlaps. We assessed the average brain complexity of the entire brain and brain regions for both groups across age categories. Cluster analysis was conducted using generalized association plots to identify brain regions with similar developmental complexity trajectories. Finally, the relationship between brain region complexity and autistic traits was examined. Results Autistic individuals may tend toward higher whole-brain complexity during adolescence and lower complexity during childhood and adulthood, indicating possible distinct developmental trajectories. However, these results do not remain after Bonferroni correction. Two clusters of brain regions were identified, each with unique patterns of complexity changes over time. Correlations between brain region complexity, age, and autistic traits were also identified. Conclusion The study revealed brain complexity trajectories in autistic individuals, providing insight into the neurodiversity of autism and suggesting that age-related changes in brain complexity could be a potential neurodevelopmental marker for the dynamic nature of autism.;,citation_author=I-Jou Chi;,citation_author=Shih-Jen Tsai;,citation_author=Chun-Houh Chen;,citation_author=Albert C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Scale-free brain dynamics under physical and psychological distress: Pre-treatment effects in women diagnosed with breast cancer;,citation_abstract=Abstract Stressful life events are related to negative outcomes, including physical and psychological manifestations of distress, and behavioral deficits. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer report impaired attention and working memory prior to adjuvant therapy, which may be induced by distress. In this article, we examine whether brain dynamics show systematic changes due to the distress associated with cancer diagnosis. We hypothesized that impaired working memory is associated with suppression of “long-memory” neuronal dynamics; we tested this by measuring scale-free (“fractal”) brain dynamics, quantified by the Hurst exponent ( H ). Fractal scaling refers to signals that do not occur at a specific time-scale, possessing a spectral power curve ; they are “long-memory” processes, with significant autocorrelations. In a BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we scanned three groups during a working memory task: women scheduled to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy and aged-matched controls. Surprisingly, patients’ BOLD signal exhibited greater H with increasing intensity of anticipated treatment. However, an analysis of H and functional connectivity against self-reported measures of psychological distress (Worry, Anxiety, Depression) and physical distress (Fatigue, Sleep problems) revealed significant interactions. The modulation of (Worry, Anxiety) versus (Fatigue, Sleep Problems, Depression) showed the strongest effect, where higher worry and lower fatigue was related to reduced H in regions involved in visuospatial search, attention, and memory processing. This is also linked to decreased functional connectivity in these brain regions. Our results indicate that the distress associated with cancer diagnosis alters BOLD scaling, and H is a sensitive measure of the interaction between psychological versus physical distress.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The suppression of scale-free fMRI brain dynamics across three different sources of effort: Aging, task novelty and task difficulty;,citation_abstract=Abstract There is growing evidence that fluctuations in brain activity may exhibit scale-free (“fractal”) dynamics. Scale-free signals follow a spectral-power curve of the form P ( f  ) $\propto$  f -$\beta$ , where spectral power decreases in a power-law fashion with increasing frequency. In this study, we demonstrated that fractal scaling of BOLD fMRI signal is consistently suppressed for different sources of cognitive effort. Decreases in the Hurst exponent ( H ), which quantifies scale-free signal, was related to three different sources of cognitive effort/task engagement: 1) task difficulty, 2) task novelty, and 3) aging effects. These results were consistently observed across multiple datasets and task paradigms. We also demonstrated that estimates of H are robust across a range of time-window sizes. H was also compared to alternative metrics of BOLD variability (SD BOLD ) and global connectivity (Gconn), with effort-related decreases in H producing similar decreases in SD BOLD and Gconn. These results indicate a potential global brain phenomenon that unites research from different fields and indicates that fractal scaling may be a highly sensitive metric for indexing cognitive effort/task engagement.;,citation_author=Nathan W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Log Wavelet Leaders Cumulant Based Multifractal Analysis of EVI fMRI Time Series: Evidence of Scaling in Ongoing and Evoked Brain Activity;,citation_abstract=Classical within-subject analysis in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) relies on a detection step to localize which parts of the brain are activated by a given stimulus type. This is usually achieved using model-based approaches. Here, we propose an alternative exploratory analysis. The originality of this contribution is twofold. First, we propose a synthetic, consistent, and comparative overview of the various stochastic processes and estimation procedures used to model and analyze scale invariance. Notably, it is explained how multifractal models are more versatile to adjust the scaling properties of fMRI data but require more elaborated analysis procedures. Second, we bring evidence of the existence of actual scaling in fMRI time series that are clearly disentangled from putative superimposed nonstationarities. By nature, scaling analysis requires the use of long enough signals with high frequency sampling rate. To this end, we make use of a localized 3-D echo volume imaging (EVI) technique, which has recently emerged in fMRI because it allows very fast acquisitions of successive brain volumes. High temporal resolution EVI fMRI data have been acquired both in resting state and during a slow event-related visual paradigm. A voxel-based systematic multifractal analysis has been performed over both kinds of data. Combining multifractal attribute estimates together with paired statistical tests, we observe significant scaling parameter changes between ongoing and evoked brain activity, which clearly validate an increase in long memory and suggest a global multifractality decrease effect under activation.;,citation_author=Philippe Ciuciu;,citation_author=Patrice Abry;,citation_author=Cécile Rabrait;,citation_author=Herwig Wendt;,citation_publication_date=2008-12;,citation_cover_date=2008-12;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2006663;,citation_issn=1941-0484;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multiple Functional Brain Networks Related to Pain Perception Revealed by fMRI;,citation_abstract=Abstract The rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to a deeper understanding of cortical processing of pain. Central to these advances has been the identification and analysis of “functional networks”, often derived from groups of pre-selected pain regions. In this study our main objective was to identify functional brain networks related to pain perception by examining whole-brain activation, avoiding the need for a priori selection of regions. We applied a data-driven technique—Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)—that identifies networks without assuming their anatomical or temporal properties. Open-source fMRI data collected during a thermal pain task (33 healthy participants) were subjected to fMRI-CPCA for network extraction, and networks were associated with pain perception by modelling subjective pain ratings as a function of network activation intensities. Three functional networks emerged: a sensorimotor response network, a salience-mediated attention network, and the default-mode network. Together, these networks constituted a brain state that explained variability in pain perception, both within and between individuals, demonstrating the potential of data-driven, whole-brain functional network techniques for the analysis of pain imaging data.;,citation_author=Matteo Damascelli;,citation_author=Todd S.

While previous studies indicate that BEN is correlated with cognition, it remains unclear whether BEN is influenced by other factors that typically affect brain activity measured by fMRI. Purpose To investigate the relationship between BEN and physiological indices, including respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (s-BP), and body mass index (BMI), and to investigate whether and to what extent the relationship between BEN and cognition is influenced by physiological variables. Study Type Retrospective. Subjects One thousand two hundred six healthy subjects (mean age: 28.83  3.69 years; 550 male) with rsfMRI datasets selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Field Strength/Sequence Multiband echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence at 3.0 Tesla. Assessment Neurocognitive, physical health (RR, HR, s-BP, BMI), and rsfMRI data were retrieved from the HCP datasets. Neurocognition was measured through the total cognition composite (TCC) score provided by HCP. BEN maps were calculated from rsfMRI data. Statistical Tests Multiple regression models, p height -family wise error (FWE) $&amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05 and p cluster -FWE $<$ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results BEN was negatively associated with RR ( T -thresholds ranging from 4.75 to 4.8; r -threshold = ) and positively associated with s-BP and BMI ( T -thresholds ranging from 4.75 to 4.8; r -threshold = ) in areas overlapping with the default mode network. After controlling the physiological effects, BEN still showed regional associations with TCC, including negative associations ( T -thresholds = 3.09; r -threshold = ) in the fronto-parietal cortex and positive associations ( T -thresholds = 3.09; r -threshold = ) in the sensorimotor system (motor network and the limbic system). Data Conclusions RR negatively affects rsfMRI-derived BEN, while s-BP and BMI positively affect BEN. The positive associations between BEN and cognition in the motor network and the limbic system might indicate a facilitation of information processing in the sensorimotor system.

We used brain entropy (BEN) estimated from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data to investigate the neural correlates of pain experience. BEN was estimated from rs-fMRI data provided by two datasets with different age range: the Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) and the Human Connectome project-Aging (HCP-A) datasets. Retrospective assessment of experienced pain intensity was retrieved from both datasets. No main effect of pain intensity was observed. The interaction between pain and age, however, was related to increased BEN in several pain-related brain regions, reflecting greater variability of spontaneous brain activity. Dividing the sample into a young adult group (YG) and a middle age-aging group (MAG) resulted in two divergent patterns of pain–BEN association: In the YG, pain intensity was related to reduced BEN in brain regions involved in the sensory processing of pain; in the MAG, pain was associated with increased BEN in areas related to both sensory and cognitive aspects of pain experience.;,citation_author=Gianpaolo Del Mauro;,citation_author=Landrew Samuel Sevel;,citation_author=Jeff Boissoneault;,citation_author=Ze Wang;,citation_publication_date=2024-05;,citation_cover_date=2024-05;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/jnr.25341;,citation_issn=0360-4012, 1097-4547;,citation_volume=102;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Neuroscience Research;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating and Comparing Measures of Aperiodic Neural Activity;,citation_abstract=Abstract Neuro-electrophysiological recordings contain prominent aperiodic activity – meaning irregular activity, with no characteristic frequency – which has variously been referred to as 1/f (or 1/f-like activity), fractal, or “scale-free” activity. Previous work has established that aperiodic features of neural activity is dynamic and variable, relating (between subjects) to healthy aging and to clinical diagnoses, and also (within subjects) tracking conscious states and behavioral performance. There are, however, a wide variety of conceptual frameworks and associated methods for the analyses and interpretation of aperiodic activity – for example, time domain measures such as the autocorrelation, fractal measures, and/or various complexity and entropy measures, as well as measures of the aperiodic exponent in the frequency domain. There is a lack of clear understanding of how these different measures relate to each other and to what extent they reflect the same or different properties of the data, which makes it difficult to synthesize results across approaches and complicates our overall understanding of the properties, biological significance, and demographic, clinical, and behavioral correlates of aperiodic neural activity. To address this problem, in this project we systematically survey the different approaches for measuring aperiodic neural activity, starting with an automated literature analysis to curate a collection of the most common methods. We then evaluate and compare these methods, using statistically representative time series simulations. In doing so, we establish consistent relationships between the measures, showing that much of what they capture reflects shared variance – though with some notable idiosyncrasies. Broadly, frequency domain methods are more specific to aperiodic features of the data, whereas time domain measures are more impacted by oscillatory activity. We extend this analysis by applying the measures to a series of empirical EEG and iEEG datasets, replicating the simulation results. We conclude by summarizing the relationships between the multiple methods, emphasizing opportunities for re-examining previous findings and for future work.;,citation_author=Thomas Donoghue;,citation_author=Ryan Hammonds;,citation_author=Eric Lybrand;,citation_author=Leonhard Washcke;,citation_author=Richard Gao;,citation_author=Bradley Voytek;,citation_publication_date=2024-09;,citation_cover_date=2024-09;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1101/2024.09.15.613114;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Long-range temporal correlation development in resting-state fMRI signal in preterm infants: Scanned shortly after birth and at term-equivalent age;,citation_abstract=While the newborn’s brain is functionally organised early on—with similar resting state networks as those of adults present at birth—these networks continue to develop at different rates and in complex ways over time. While most in vivo functional imaging studies examine the spatial characteristics of resting state networks (RSNs), such as their size or the degree of connectivity, the temporal characteristics of these networks are less well characterised. We set out to examine the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using the Hurst exponent in various RSNs in infants born very preterm shortly after birth ($&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 32 weeks gestational age; n = 64) and again later at term equivalent age (TEA) (n = 69). The Hurst exponent in grey matter and white matter was 0.69 at preterm age and increased significantly to 0.80 at TEA, with a greater difference between the tissues at TEA. The Hurst exponent in RSNs similarly was found to be approximately 0.68 for most networks at preterm age but increased significantly at different rates by TEA: 0.77 and 0.76 in the cerebellum and frontal networks respectively, and 0.84 and 0.83 in the motor and visual networks respectively. This pattern is partly consistent with findings from previous functional connectivity fMRI studies that the general growth and maturation of RSNs occur first and develop more quickly in sensory and motor networks, but later in associative networks like frontal ones. Importantly, this is the first time that this pattern has been shown in the LRTC of the fMRI BOLD signal itself, an area of study that may provide greater insight into functional brain development.;,citation_author=Johann P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spatiotemporal complexity patterns of resting-state bioelectrical activity explain fluid intelligence: Sex matters;,citation_abstract=Abstract Neural complexity is thought to be associated with efficient information processing but the exact nature of this relation remains unclear. Here, the relationship of fluid intelligence ( gf ) with the resting-state EEG (rsEEG) complexity over different timescales and different electrodes was investigated. A 6-min rsEEG blocks of eyes open were analyzed. The results of 119 subjects (57 men, mean age = 22.85  2.84 years) were examined using multivariate multiscale sample entropy (mMSE) that quantifies changes in information richness of rsEEG in multiple data channels at fine and coarse timescales. gf factor was extracted from six intelligence tests. Partial least square regression analysis revealed that mainly predictors of the rsEEG complexity at coarse timescales in the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the temporo-parietal complexities at fine timescales were relevant to higher gf. Sex differently affected the relationship between fluid intelligence and EEG complexity at rest. In men, gf was mainly positively related to the complexity at coarse timescales in the FPN. Furthermore, at fine and coarse timescales positive relations in the parietal region were revealed. In women, positive relations with gf were mostly observed for the overall and the coarse complexity in the FPN, whereas negative associations with gf were found for the complexity at fine timescales in the parietal and centro-temporal region. These outcomes indicate that two separate time pathways (corresponding to fine and coarse timescales) used to characterize rsEEG complexity (expressed by mMSE features) are beneficial for effective information processing.;,citation_author=Joanna Dreszer;,citation_author=Marek Grochowski;,citation_author=Monika Lewandowska;,citation_author=Jan Nikadon;,citation_author=Joanna Gorgol;,citation_author=Bibianna Bałaj;,citation_author=Karolina Finc;,citation_author=Włodzisław Duch;,citation_author=Patrycja Kałamała;,citation_author=Adam Chuderski;,citation_author=Tomasz Piotrowski;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=17;,citation_doi=10.1002/hbm.25162;,citation_issn=1065-9471, 1097-0193;,citation_volume=41;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Human Brain Mapping;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fractal and Noisy CBV Dynamics in Humans: Influence of Age and Gender;,citation_abstract=The complexity of spontaneous cerebral blood volume (CBV) fluctuations can emerge from random, fractal, or chaotic processes. Our aims were to define the contribution of these patterns to the observed complexity and to evaluate the effect of age and gender on it. The total hemoglobin content as the measure of CBV was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy on volunteers (men n = 19, age = 20 to 78 years; women n = 23, age = 21 to 79 years). Random and fractal patterns were distinguished by the spectral index ( $\beta$). Chaos was identified by surrogate analysis of the correlation dimension (a static chaotic parameter, the dimension of the correlation integral) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (a dynamic chaotic parameter, the rate of exponential divergence of the system states from a perturbed initial condition over the chaotic attractor). In spontaneous CBV fluctuations, both fast random and slow fractal dynamics are present separately in their spectra by a cutoff frequency, f$\prime$. Below f$\prime$ the pattern is fractal, in that power rises inversely with frequency as 1/ f $\beta$ . f$\prime$ decreases with age in men and women alike (F1: up to 0.12  0.06 Hz versus F2: up to 0.05  0.04 Hz at P = 0.015, and M1: up to 0.16  0.05 Hz versus M2: up to 0.11  0.04 Hz at P = 0.044). Neither pre- nor postmenopausal age groups (1 and 2, respectively) showed a low $\beta$ gender difference. Surrogate analysis showed that CBV dynamics cannot be characterized on the grounds of deterministic chaos. Cerebral blood volume fluctuates in a complex, bimodal manner in humans, in that the fast dynamics has no structure, while the slow dynamics exhibits a self-similar, that is, fractal temporal structure. The range of fluctuation amplitudes produced by fractal dynamics is always larger than that of random fluctuations, and it shrinks with an altered structuring in aging women only.;,citation_author=Andras Eke;,citation_author=Péter Hermán;,citation_author=Márton Hajnal;,citation_publication_date=2006-07;,citation_cover_date=2006-07;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600243;,citation_issn=0271-678X, 1559-7016;,citation_volume=26;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp;amp;amp; Metabolism;">

In this study, we try to identify RSNs from microstates of cortical surface maps of the BOLD signal. In addition, the scale-free dynamics of these map sequences were also examined. The structural and resting state functional MRI images were acquired on a 3T scanner with three different fMRI acquisition protocols from seven subjects. Microstate segmentations from EEG, fMRI, and simulated data were evaluated. Wavelet-based fractal analysis was performed on map sequence time series and the Hurst exponent (H) was calculated. By using HRF-deconvolved fMRI time series, the effect of the HRF (hemodynamic response function) on fMRI-derived microstates was tested. The fMRI map sequence has a system with a memory system smaller than 16 s. When the HRF was deconvolved, the duration of the memory of the system was reduced to 4 s. On the other hand, the results of simulation data indicated that these systems are specific to the resting state BOLD signal. Similar to EEG microstates, fMRI also has microstates and both of them have scale-free dynamics. fMRI microstate dynamics have two different components, one is related to the HRF and the other is independent of the HRF. The significance of fMRI microstates and their relation with RSNs need to be further studied.;,citation_author=Nurhan Erbil;,citation_author=Gopikrishna Deshpande;,citation_publication_date=2025-02;,citation_cover_date=2025-02;,citation_year=2025;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.3390/fractalfract9020112;,citation_issn=2504-3110;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Fractal and Fractional;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Self-similar correlation function in brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging;,citation_abstract=Adaptive behaviour, cognition and emotion are the result of a bewildering variety of brain spatio-temporal activity patterns. An important problem in neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain’s 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must still perform as a collective, i.e. they are functionally integrated. Here, we investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character of the spatio-temporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data exhibits self-similarity in space and time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency behaviour of the power spectrum.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Closer to critical resting-state neural dynamics in individuals with higher fluid intelligence;,citation_abstract=According to the critical brain hypothesis, the brain is considered to operate near criticality and realize efficient neural computations. Despite the prior theoretical and empirical evidence in favor of the hypothesis, no direct link has been provided between human cognitive performance and the neural criticality. Here we provide such a key link by analyzing resting-state dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks at a whole-brain level. We develop a data-driven analysis method, inspired from statistical physics theory of spin systems, to map out the whole-brain neural dynamics onto a phase diagram. Using this tool, we show evidence that neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence quotient scores are closer to a critical state, i.e., the boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the spin-glass (SG) phase.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating Neuroplasticity in Glioma Patients;,citation_abstract=Background: Upon glioma invasion, the human brain triggers reorganization to prevent functional deficits. More sophisticated and hierarchical neuroplasticity mechanisms are proposed for low-grade glioma (LGG) but not for high-grade glioma (HGG). In contrast to local activity, quantifying the complexity, variability and predictability of a signal (i.e., entropy) might be especially suited to investigate HGGs and LGGs impact on (compensatory) neuroplasticity. Firstly, it is hypothesized that entropy patterns differ between healthy controls (HC) and glioma patients. Secondly, LGGs and HGGs are assumed to show consistently different (=invariably higher or lower) entropy scores across regions of interests (ROIs). Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data was obtained from a sample [age: 47  15] consisting of 85 HGGs, 76 LGGs patients, and 51 healthy controls (HCs). Tumor, peritumor, distal ipsilateral, and contralateral ROIs were defined. Mixed-design ANOVAs were conducted to examine differences between sample entropy scores per condition. Various parameter choices for sample entropy extraction were made, with conclusions based on majority agreement. Results: Significantly lower sample entropy scores for glioma patients compared to HCs became prominent for ipsilateral and contralateral ROIs. No significant differences between HGGs and LGGs were observed. Discussion: The results suggest that glioma patients may exhibit compensatory or over-excessive plasticity in contralateral and ipsilateral regions after tumor invasion, resulting in more predictable and less complex processing. The lack of significant differences between HGGs and LGGs suggests similar plasticity mechanisms irrespective of grading (contralateral, ipsilateral reduction in sample entropy) to a similar extent (reduced to the same degree).;,citation_author=Jonas Festor;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Consciousness among delta waves: A paradox?;,citation_abstract=A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the appearance of delta (1–4 Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high amplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are frequently observed in states of diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalized epileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness, such as coma and the vegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high amplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical deactivation that occurs during the “down states” or troughs of these slow oscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of prominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the hypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of unconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, behavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful psychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely unacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients with high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a largely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the complexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalographic signals strongly relates to an individual’s level of consciousness. Having reviewed this literature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming contradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We also consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we conclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by examining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral power.;,citation_author=Joel Frohlich;,citation_author=Daniel Toker;,citation_author=Martin M Monti;,citation_publication_date=2021-08;,citation_cover_date=2021-08;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1093/brain/awab095;,citation_issn=0006-8950;,citation_volume=144;,citation_journal_title=Brain;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural complexity is a common denominator of human consciousness across diverse regimes of cortical dynamics;,citation_abstract=What is the common denominator of consciousness across divergent regimes of cortical dynamics? Does consciousness show itself in decibels or in bits? To address these questions, we introduce a testbed for evaluating electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of consciousness using dissociations between neural oscillations and consciousness caused by rare genetic disorders. Children with Angelman syndrome (AS) exhibit sleep-like neural dynamics during wakefulness. Conversely, children with duplication 15q11.2-13.1 syndrome (Dup15q) exhibit wake-like neural dynamics during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. To identify highly generalizable biomarkers of consciousness, we trained regularized logistic regression classifiers on EEG data from wakefulness and NREM sleep in children with AS using both entropy measures of neural complexity and spectral (i.e., neural oscillatory) EEG features. For each set of features, we then validated these classifiers using EEG from neurotypical (NT) children and abnormal EEGs from children with Dup15q. Our results show that the classification performance of entropy-based EEG biomarkers of conscious state is not upper-bounded by that of spectral EEG features, which are outperformed by entropy features. Entropy-based biomarkers of consciousness may thus be highly adaptable and should be investigated further in situations where spectral EEG features have shown limited success, such as detecting covert consciousness or anesthesia awareness.;,citation_author=Joel Frohlich;,citation_author=Jeffrey N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Abnormalities in Brain Complexity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Sleeping State Functional MRI Study.;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background and Objective: The theory of complexity loss in mentally disordered brain is widely acknowledged. However, the findings of autism research do not seem to align well with this theory. We aim to investigate the brain complexity in children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) compared with the TD (Typical Developed) children in sleeping state. Method: 42 ASD children and 42 TD children were imaged using sleep-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (ss-fMRI), and brain complexity was analyzed by employing sample entropy (SampEn) and transfer entropy (TE). For the ASD group, we also investigated the relationship of symptom severity with SampEn and with TE. Results: In compared with TD group, ASD group showed significant elevated SampEn in the right inferior frontal gyrus. However, in the group of TD, 13 pairs of brain regions exhibit higher TE compared to the ASD group. In the ASD group, the TE of 5 pairs of brain regions is higher than in the TD group. A positive correlation was found between cerebellum-amygdala TE in ASD group and ABC total scores. Conclusion: This sleeping-state fMRI study provide evidence that ASD children exhibited aberrant brain complexity in compare with the TD children. The complexity of the autistic brain is composed of aberrant randomness in brain activity and anomalous information transmission between brain regions. We propose that the abnormally diminished quantity of information transmission may potentially underlie the decreased complexity of the autistic brain.;,citation_author=Shishun Fu;,citation_author=Xiang Wang;,citation_author=Ziwei Chen;,citation_author=Zengfa Huang;,citation_author=Yin Feng;,citation_author=Yuanliang Xie;,citation_author=Xiang Li;,citation_author=Chunlan Yang;,citation_author=Shoujun Xu;,citation_publication_date=2024-10;,citation_cover_date=2024-10;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.21203/rs.3.rs-4966735/v1;,citation_publisher=In Review;">

In this study, an optimization algorithm that could choose the parameters of the multiscale entropy (MSE) model was developed, while the optimized effectiveness for localizing the epileptogenic hemisphere was validated through the classification rate with a supervised machine learning method. The rfMRI data of 20 mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients with positive indicators (the indicators of epileptogenic hemisphere in clinic) in the hippocampal formation on either left or right hemisphere (equally divided into two groups) on the structural MRI were collected and preprocessed. Then, three parameters in the MSE model were statistically optimized by both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve value in the sensitivity analysis, and the intergroup significance of optimized entropy values was utilized to confirm the biomarked brain areas sensitive to the epileptogenic hemisphere. Finally, the optimized entropy values of these biomarked brain areas were regarded as the feature vectors input for a support vector machine to classify the epileptogenic hemisphere, and the classification effectiveness was cross-validated. Nine biomarked brain areas were confirmed by the optimized entropy values, including medial superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal gyrus ( p  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .01). The mean classification accuracy was greater than 90%. It can be concluded that combination of the optimized MSE model with the machine learning model can accurately confirm the epileptogenic hemisphere by rfMRI.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Temporal dynamic patterns of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex underlie the association between rumination and depression;,citation_abstract=Abstract As a major contributor to the development of depression, rumination has proven linked with aberrant default-mode network (DMN) activity. However, it remains unclear how the spontaneous spatial and temporal activity of DMN underlie the association between rumination and depression. To illustrate this issue, behavioral measures and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were connected in 2 independent samples (NSample1 = 100, NSample2 = 95). Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to assess spatial characteristic patterns, while voxel-wise functional concordance (across time windows) (VC) and Hurst exponent (HE) were used to assess temporal dynamic patterns of brain activity. Results from both samples consistently show that temporal dynamics but not spatial patterns of DMN are associated with rumination. Specifically, rumination is positively correlated with HE and VC (but not fALFF and ReHo) values, reflecting more consistent and regular temporal dynamic patterns in DMN. Moreover, subregion analyses indicate that temporal dynamics of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) reliably predict rumination scores. Furthermore, mediation analyses show that HE and VC of VMPFC mediate the association between rumination and depression. These findings shed light on neural mechanisms of individual differences in rumination and corresponding risk for depression.;,citation_author=Wei Gao;,citation_author=Bharat Biswal;,citation_author=Jiemin Yang;,citation_author=Songlin Li;,citation_author=YanQing Wang;,citation_author=Shengdong Chen;,citation_author=JiaJin Yuan;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1093/cercor/bhac115;,citation_issn=1047-3211, 1460-2199;,citation_volume=33;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Cerebral Cortex;">

We examined fMRI signal variability during fixation baseline periods, and then compared SD- and mean-based spatial patterns and their relations with chronological age (20–85 years). We found that not only was the SD-based pattern robust, it differed greatly, both spatially and statistically, from the mean-based pattern.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The “limbic network,” comprising orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortex, is part of an extended default network: Evidence from multi-echo fMRI;,citation_abstract=Abstract Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations have provided a view of the default network (DN) as composed of a specific set of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical regions. This spatial topography is typically defined with reference to an influential network parcellation scheme that designated the DN as one of seven large-scale networks (Yeo et al., 2011). However, the precise functional organization of the DN is still under debate, with studies arguing for varying subnetwork configurations and the inclusion of subcortical regions. In this vein, the so-called limbic network—defined as a distinct large-scale network comprising the bilateral temporal poles, ventral anterior temporal lobes, and orbitofrontal cortex—is of particular interest. A large multi-modal and multi-species literature on the anatomical, functional, and cognitive properties of these regions suggests a close relationship to the DN. Notably, these regions have poor signal quality with conventional fMRI acquisition, likely obscuring their network affiliation in most studies. Here, we leverage a multi-echo fMRI dataset with high temporal signal-to-noise and whole-brain coverage, including orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions, to examine the large-scale network resting-state functional connectivity of these regions and assess their associations with the DN. Consistent with our hypotheses, our results support the inclusion of the majority of the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortex as part of the DN and reveal significant heterogeneity in their functional connectivity. We observed that left-lateralized regions within the temporal poles and ventral anterior temporal lobes, as well as medial orbitofrontal regions, exhibited the greatest resting-state functional connectivity with the DN, with heterogeneity across DN subnetworks. Overall, our findings suggest that, rather than being a functionally distinct network, the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions comprise part of a larger, extended default network.;,citation_author=Manesh Girn;,citation_author=Roni Setton;,citation_author=Gary R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=From temporal to spatial topography: Hierarchy of neural dynamics in higher- and lower-order networks shapes their complexity;,citation_abstract=The brain shows a topographical hierarchy along the lines of lower- and higher-order networks. The exact temporal dynamics characterization of this lower-higher-order topography at rest and its impact on task states remains unclear, though. Using 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets, we investigate lower- and higher-order networks in terms of the signal compressibility, operationalized by Lempel–Ziv complexity (LZC). As we assume that this degree of complexity is related to the slow–fast frequency balance, we also compute the median frequency (MF), an estimation of frequency distribution. We demonstrate (i) topographical differences at rest between higher- and lower-order networks, showing lower LZC and MF in the former; (ii) task-related and task-specific changes in LZC and MF in both lower- and higher-order networks; (iii) hierarchical relationship between LZC and MF, as MF at rest correlates with LZC rest–task change along the lines of lower- and higher-order networks; and (iv) causal and nonlinear relation between LZC at rest and LZC during task, with MF at rest acting as mediator. Together, results show that the topographical hierarchy of lower- and higher-order networks converges with their temporal hierarchy, with these neural dynamics at rest shaping their range of complexity during task states in a nonlinear way.;,citation_author=Mehrshad Golesorkhi;,citation_author=Javier Gomez-Pilar;,citation_author=Yasir Çatal;,citation_author=Shankar Tumati;,citation_author=Mustapha C E Yagoub;,citation_author=Emanuel A Stamatakis;,citation_author=Georg Northoff;,citation_publication_date=2022-12;,citation_cover_date=2022-12;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=24;,citation_doi=10.1093/cercor/bhac042;,citation_issn=1047-3211;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Cerebral Cortex;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring the complexity of time series: An application to neurophysiological signals;,citation_abstract=Measures of signal complexity can be used to distinguish neurophysiological activation from noise in those neuroimaging techniques where we record variations of brain activity with time, e.g., fMRI, EEG, ERP. In this paper we explore a recently developed approach to calculate a quantitative measure of deterministic signal complexity and information content: The Renyi number. The Renyi number is by definition an entropy, i.e., a classically used measure of disorder in physical systems, and is calculated in this paper over the basis of the time frequency representation (TFRs) of the measured signals. When calculated in this form, the Renyi entropy (RE) indirectly characterizes the complexity of a signal by providing an approximate counting of the number of separated elementary atoms that compose the time series in the time frequency plane. In this sense, this measure conforms closely to our visual notion of complexity since low complexity values are obtained for signals formed by a small number of “components”. The most remarkable properties of this measure are twofold: 1) It does not rely on assumptions about the time series such as stationarity or gaussianity and 2) No model of the neural process under study is required, e.g., no hemodynamic response model for fMRI. The method is illustrated in this paper using fMRI, intracranial ERPs and intracranial potentials estimated from scalp recorded ERPs through an inverse solution (ELECTRA). The main theoretical and practical drawbacks of this measure, especially its dependence of the selected TFR, are discussed. Also the capability of this approach to produce, with less restrictive hypothesis, results comparable to those obtained with more standard methods but is emphasized. Hum.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain signal variability and executive functions across the life span;,citation_abstract=Abstract Neural variability is thought to facilitate survival through flexible adaptation to changing environmental demands. In humans, such capacity for flexible adaptation may manifest as fluid reasoning, inhibition of automatic responses, and mental set-switching—skills falling under the broad domain of executive functions that fluctuate over the life span. Neural variability can be quantified via the BOLD signal in resting-state fMRI. Variability of large-scale brain networks is posited to underpin complex cognitive activities requiring interactions between multiple brain regions. Few studies have examined the extent to which network-level brain signal variability across the life span maps onto high-level processes under the umbrella of executive functions. The present study leveraged a large publicly available neuroimaging dataset to investigate the relationship between signal variability and executive functions across the life span. Associations between brain signal variability and executive functions shifted as a function of age. Limbic-specific variability was consistently associated with greater performance across subcomponents of executive functions. Associations between executive function subcomponents and network-level variability of the default mode and central executive networks, as well as whole-brain variability, varied across the life span. Findings suggest that brain signal variability may help to explain to age-related differences in executive functions across the life span.;,citation_author=Zachary T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the estimation of brain signal entropy from sparse neuroimaging data;,citation_abstract=Multi-scale entropy (MSE) has been recently established as a promising tool for the analysis of the moment-to-moment variability of neural signals. Appealingly, MSE provides a measure of the predictability of neural operations across the multiple time scales on which the brain operates. An important limitation in the application of the MSE to some classes of neural signals is MSE’s apparent reliance on long time series. However, this sparse-data limitation in MSE computation could potentially be overcome via MSE estimation across shorter time series that are not necessarily acquired continuously (e.g., in fMRI block-designs). In the present study, using simulated, EEG, and fMRI data, we examined the dependence of the accuracy and precision of MSE estimates on the number of data points per segment and the total number of data segments. As hypothesized, MSE estimation across discontinuous segments was comparably accurate and precise, despite segment length. A key advance of our approach is that it allows the calculation of MSE scales not previously accessible from the native segment lengths. Consequently, our results may permit a far broader range of applications of MSE when gauging moment-to-moment dynamics in sparse and/or discontinuous neurophysiological data typical of many modern cognitive neuroscience study designs.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

Although considerable progress has been made, a comprehensive picture has yet to emerge, and needs further linking to a mechanistic account of brain function. Here, we review these concepts, connecting observations across different levels of organization, from both a structural and functional perspective. We argue that, paradoxically, the level of cortical circuits is the least understood from a structural point of view and perhaps the best studied from a dynamical one. We further link observations about scale-freeness and fractality with evidence that the environment provides constraints that may explain the usefulness of fractal structure and scale-free dynamics in the brain. Moreover, we discuss evidence that behavior exhibits scale-free properties, likely emerging from similarly organized brain dynamics, enabling an organism to thrive in an environment that shares the same organizational principles. Finally, we review the sparse evidence for and try to speculate on the functional consequences of fractality and scale-freeness for brain computation. These properties may endow the brain with computational capabilities that transcend current models of neural computation and could hold the key to unraveling how the brain constructs percepts and generates behavior.;,citation_author=George F Grosu;,citation_author=Alexander V Hopp;,citation_author=Vasile V Moca;,citation_author=Harald Bârzan;,citation_author=Andrei Ciuparu;,citation_author=Maria Ercsey-Ravasz;,citation_author=Mathias Winkel;,citation_author=Helmut Linde;,citation_author=Raul C Muresan;,citation_publication_date=2023-04;,citation_cover_date=2023-04;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1093/cercor/bhac363;,citation_issn=1047-3211;,citation_volume=33;,citation_journal_title=Cerebral Cortex;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wavelet entropy of BOLD time series: An application to Rolandic epilepsy;,citation_abstract=Purpose To assess the wavelet entropy for the characterization of intrinsic aberrant temporal irregularities in the time series of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Further, to evaluate the temporal irregularities (disorder/order) on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy. Materials and Methods The BOLD time series was decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet entropy was calculated. Using a model time series consisting of multiple harmonics and nonstationary components, the wavelet entropy was compared with Shannon and spectral (Fourier-based) entropy. As an application, the wavelet entropy in 22 children with Rolandic epilepsy was compared to 22 age-matched healthy controls. The images were obtained by performing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a 3T system, an 8-element receive-only head coil, and an echo planar imaging pulse sequence ( -weighted). The wavelet entropy was also compared to spectral entropy, regional homogeneity, and Shannon entropy. Results Wavelet entropy was found to identify the nonstationary components of the model time series. In Rolandic epilepsy patients, a significantly elevated wavelet entropy was observed relative to controls for the whole cerebrum ( P  = 0.03). Spectral entropy ( P  = 0.41), regional homogeneity ( P  = 0.52), and Shannon entropy ( P  = 0.32) did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion The wavelet entropy measure appeared more sensitive to detect abnormalities in cerebral fluctuations represented by nonstationary effects in the BOLD time series than more conventional measures. This effect was observed in the model time series as well as in Rolandic epilepsy. These observations suggest that the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy exhibit stronger nonstationary temporal signal fluctuations than controls.

Altered fractal dynamics of gait: reduced stride-interval correlations with aging and Huntington’s disease. J. Appl. Physiol. 82(1): 262–269, 1997.—Fluctuations in the duration of the gait cycle (the stride interval) display fractal dynamics and long-range correlations in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that these stride-interval correlations would be altered by changes in neurological function associated with aging and certain disease states. To test this hypothesis, we compared the stride-interval time series of 1) healthy elderly subjects and young controls and of 2) subjects with Huntington’s disease and healthy controls. Using detrended fluctuation analysis, we computed $\alpha$, a measure of the degree to which one stride interval is correlated with previous and subsequent intervals over different time scales. The scaling exponent $\alpha$ was significantly lower in elderly subjects compared with young subjects (elderly: 0.68  0.14; young: 0.87  0.15; P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.003). The scaling exponent $\alpha$ was also smaller in the subjects with Huntington’s disease compared with disease-free controls (Huntington’s disease: 0.60  0.24; controls: 0.88  0.17; P $&amp;lt;$ 0.005). Moreover, $\alpha$ was linearly related to degree of functional impairment in subjects with Huntington’s disease ( r = 0.78, P $<$ 0.0005). These findings demonstrate that stride-interval fluctuations are more random (i.e., less correlated) in elderly subjects and in subjects with Huntington’s disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is criticality a unified set-point of brain function?;,citation_abstract=ABSTRACT Brains face selective pressure to optimize computation, broadly defined. This optimization is achieved by myriad mechanisms and processes that influence the brain’s computational state. These include development, plasticity, homeostasis, and more. Despite enormous variability over time and between individuals, do these diverse mechanisms converge on the same set-point? Is there a universal computational optimum around which the healthy brain tunes itself? The criticality hypothesis posits such a unified computational set-point. Criticality is a special dynamical brain state, defined by internally-generated multi-scale, marginally-stable dynamics which maximize many features of information processing. The first experimental support for this hypothesis emerged two decades ago, and evidence has accumulated at an accelerating pace, despite a contentious history. Here, we lay out the logic of criticality as a general computational end-point and systematically review experimental evidence for the hypothesis. We perform a meta-analysis of 143 datasets from manuscripts published between 2003 and 2024. To our surprise, we find that a long-standing controversy in the field is the product of a simple methodological choice that has no bearing on underlying dynamics.

The pial networks appear random and at the same time having structural elements similar to each other when viewed at different scales–a property known as self-similarity revealed by the geometry of fractals. Fractal (capacity) dimension, Dcap, was calculated to evaluate the network’s spatial complexity by the box counting method (BCM) and its variant, the extended counting method (XCM). Box counting method and XCM were subject to numerical testing on ideal fractals of known D. The authors found that precision of these fractal methods depends on the fractal character (branching, nonbranching) of the structure they evaluate.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain Complexity and Psychiatric Disorders;,citation_abstract=Objective: In recent years, researchers and neuroscientists have begun to use a variety of nonlinear techniques for analyzing neurophysiologic signals derived from fMRI, MEG, and EEG in order to describe the complex dynamical aspects of neural mechanisms. In this work, we first attempted to describe different algorithms to estimate neural complexity in a simple manner understandable for psychiatrists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. Then, we reviewed the findings of the brain complexity analysis in psychiatric disorders and their clinical implications. Method: A non-systematic comprehensive literature search was conducted for original studies on the complexity analysis of neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalogram, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near infrared spectroscopy. The search encompassed online scientific databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: Complexity measures mainly include entropy-based methods, the correlation dimension, fractal dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the Lyapunov exponent. There are important differences in the physical notions between these measures. Our literature review shows that dementia, autism, and adult ADHD exhibit less complexity in their neurophysiologic signals than healthy controls. However, children with ADHD, drug-naïve young schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms, and patients with mood disorders (i.e., depression and bipolar disorder) exhibit higher complexity in their neurophysiologic signals compared to healthy controls. In addition, contradictory findings still exist in some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia regarding brain complexity, which can be due to technical issues, large heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders, and interference of typical factors. Conclusion: In summary, complexity analysis may present a new dimension to understanding psychiatric disorders. While complexity analysis is still far from having practical applications in routine clinical settings, complexity science can play an important role in comprehending the system dynamics of psychiatric disorders.;,citation_author=Ronald Miguel Hernández;,citation_author=Jacqueline Cynthia Ponce-Meza;,citation_author=Miguel Ángel Saavedra-López;,citation_author=Walter Antonio Campos Ugaz;,citation_author=Roxana Monteza Chanduvi;,citation_author=Walter Campos Monteza;,citation_publication_date=2023-09;,citation_cover_date=2023-09;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13637;,citation_issn=1735-4587, 2008-2215;,citation_journal_title=Iranian Journal of Psychiatry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Scale-Free Properties of the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signal during Rest and Task;,citation_abstract=It has been shown recently that a significant portion of brain electrical field potentials consists of scale-free dynamics. These scale-free brain dynamics contain complex spatiotemporal structures and are modulated by task performance. Here we show that the fMRI signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with fMRI signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the fMRI signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the fMRI signal. The scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity. In summary, our results demonstrate the functional relevance of scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and impose constraints on future models of neurovascular coupling.;,citation_author=Biyu J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Default Mode Network, Disorganization, and Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background and Hypothesis Disorganized thinking is a prominent feature of schizophrenia that becomes persistent in the presence of treatment resistance. Disruption of the&nbsp;default mode network (DMN), which regulates self-referential thinking, is now a well-established feature of schizophrenia. However, we do not know if DMN disruption affects disorganization and contributes to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Study Design This study investigated the&nbsp;DMN in 48 TRS, 76 non-TRS, and 64 healthy controls (HC) using a spatiotemporal approach with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We recovered DMN as an integrated network using multivariate group independent component analysis and estimated its loading coefficient (reflecting spatial prominence) and Shannon Entropy (reflecting temporal variability). Additionally, voxel-level analyses were conducted to examine network homogeneity and entropy within the DMN. We explored the relationship between DMN measures and disorganization using regression analysis. Results TRS had higher spatial loading on population-level DMN pattern, but lower entropy compared to HC. Non-TRS patients showed intermediate DMN alterations, not significantly differing from either TRS or HC. No voxel-level differences were noted between TRS and non-TRS, emphasizing the continuum between the two groups. DMN’s loading coefficient was higher in patients with more severe disorganization. Conclusions TRS may represent the most severe end of a spectrum of spatiotemporal DMN dysfunction in schizophrenia. While excessive spatial contribution of the DMN (high loading coefficient) is specifically associated with disorganization, both excessive spatial contribution and exaggerated temporal stability of DMN are features of schizophrenia that become more pronounced with refractoriness to first-line treatments.;,citation_author=Huan Huang;,citation_author=Xuan Qin;,citation_author=Rui Xu;,citation_author=Ying Xiong;,citation_author=Keke Hao;,citation_author=Cheng Chen;,citation_author=Qirong Wan;,citation_author=Hao Liu;,citation_author=Wei Yuan;,citation_author=Yunlong Peng;,citation_author=Yuan Zhou;,citation_author=Huiling Wang;,citation_author=Lena Palaniyappan;,citation_publication_date=2025-03;,citation_cover_date=2025-03;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1093/schbul/sbaf018;,citation_issn=0586-7614, 1745-1701;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Schizophrenia Bulletin;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Entropic Voxels Indicate Large Brain-State Repertoires;,citation_abstract=Brain entropy is a measure that has been increasingly studied in neuroscience over the past decade. It is based on Shannon Entropy, a measure from Information Theory that quantifies the information capacity of a system from the probability distribution of its states. Brain entropy is thus posited to reflect the information capacity of the brain and has been linked to various cognitive abilities and states. However, most studies on brain entropy measure the time-series entropy of each voxel independently, ignoring any patterns that emerge from the relations between voxels. Here, we measured brain entropy of resting-state fMRI data based on recurrent patterns of activation across the cortex and found that this was positively correlated with time-series entropy, suggesting that entropic voxels are indicative of large, complex repertoires of brain activation states. That said, we also found that time-series entropy measures are sensitive to frequency, as low-frequency power decreases entropy. This is potentially problematic for periodic signals, as all sinusoidal oscillations are equally predictable, and high-frequency oscillations should not be considered more entropic than low-frequency ones.;,citation_author=Adam Hull;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;">

Here, we examined how learning a motor sequence affects long-range temporal memory within resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Using the Hurst exponent (HE), we estimated voxel-wise LRTC and assessed changes over 5 consecutive days of training, followed by a retention scan 12 days later. The experimental group learned a complex visuomotor sequence while a complementary control group performed tightly matched movements. An interaction analysis revealed that HE decreases were specific to the complex sequence and occurred in well-known motor sequence learning associated regions including left supplementary motor area, left premotor cortex, left M1, left pars opercularis, bilateral thalamus, and right striatum. Five regions exhibited moderate to strong negative correlations with overall behavioral performance improvements. Following learning, HE values returned to pretraining levels in some regions, whereas in others, they remained decreased even 2 weeks after training. Our study presents new evidence of HE’s possible relevance for functional plasticity during the resting-state and suggests that a cortical subset of sequence-specific regions may continue to represent a functional signature of learning reflected in decreased long-range temporal dependence after a period of inactivity.;,citation_author=Anna-Thekla P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment from Normal Cognition: fMRI Complexity Matches Tau PET Performance;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Tau protein accumulation is closely linked to synaptic and neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), resulting in progressive cognitive decline. Although tau-PET imaging is a direct biomarker of tau pathology, it is costly, carries radiation risks, and is not widely accessible. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) complexity—an entropy-based measure of BOLD signal variation—has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate biomarker of early neuronal dysfunction associated with tau pathology. Objectives To determine whether fMRI-based brain complexity (sample entropy and multiscale entropy) can match or exceed tau-PET in classifying cognitively normal (CN) versus cognitively impaired (MCI/AD) individuals. And to investigate and compare the most influential network regions-of-interest (ROIs) for classification between fMRI complexity and tau-PET, thereby identifying key neuroanatomical correlates of AD-related changes. Design A cross-sectional study employing 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification with five-fold cross-validation and leave-one-network-out analysis. Setting Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Participants One hundred forty-seven older adults (age 72.5  7.5 years), including 95 CN, 45 MCI, and 7 AD. Measurements We created whole-brain complexity maps from rs-fMRI and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maps from tau-PET. Each modality was separately fed into CNN classifiers. Region-based analyses (leave-one-network-out) were performed to identify critical ROIs for classification. Results fMRI complexity showed classification accuracy comparable to tau-PET yet surpassed it in F1-score (0.64 vs. 0.61) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.73 vs. 0.67). Salience and dorsal attention networks contributed most to fMRI-based classification, and a dorsal attention network contributed most to tau-PET-based classification. Conclusions fMRI complexity performs similarly to tau-PET in detecting cognitive impairment related to AD and identifies partially distinct critical ROIs, suggesting an alternative, radiation- free imaging biomarker for earlier detection and broader clinical application.;,citation_author=Kay Jann;,citation_author=Gilsoon Park;,citation_author=Hosung Kim;,citation_author=the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;,citation_publication_date=2025-01;,citation_cover_date=2025-01;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1101/2025.01.16.633407;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Neuroscience;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain Entropy Study on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Using Resting-State fMRI;,citation_abstract=Object: Brain entropy is a potential index in the diagnosis of mental diseases, but there are some differences in different brain entropy calculation, which may bring confusion and difficulties to the application of brain entropy. Based on the resting-state function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we analyzed the differences of the three main brain entropy in the statistical significance, including approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), and studied the physiological reasons behind the difference through comparing their performance on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the healthy control (HC). Method: We set patients with OCD as the experimental group and healthy subjects as the control group. The brain entropy of the OCD group and the HC are calculated, respectively, by voxel and AAL region. And then we analyzed the statistical differences of the three brain entropies between the patients and the control group. To compare the sensitivity and robustness of these three kinds of entropy, we also studied their performance by using certain signal mixed with noise. Result: Compare with the control group, almost the whole brain’s ApEn and FuzzyEn of OCD are larger significantly. Besides, there are more brain regions with obvious differences when using ApEn comparing to using FuzzyEn. There was no statistical difference between the SampEn of OCD and HC. Conclusion: Brain entropy is a numerical index related to brain function and can be used as a supplementary biological index to evaluate brain state, which may be used as a reference for the diagnosis of mental illness.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unraveling Neural Complexity: Exploring Brain Entropy to Yield Mechanistic Insight in Neuromodulation Therapies for Tobacco Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=Abstract Neuromodulation therapies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have shown promise as treatments for tobacco use disorder (TUD). However, the underlying mechanisms of these therapies remain unclear, which may hamper optimization and personalization efforts. In this study, we investigated alteration of brain entropy as a potential mechanism underlying the neural effects of noninvasive brain stimulation by rTMS in people with TUD. We employed sample entropy (SampEn) to quantify the complexity and predictability of brain activity measured using resting-state fMRI data. Our study design included a randomized single-blind study with 42 participants who underwent 2 data collection sessions. During each session, participants received high-frequency (10Hz) stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or a control region (visual cortex), and resting-state fMRI scans were acquired before and after rTMS. Our findings revealed that individuals who smoke exhibited higher baseline SampEn throughout the brain as compared to previously-published SampEn measurements in control participants. Furthermore, high-frequency rTMS to the dlPFC but not the control region reduced SampEn in the insula and dlPFC, regions implicated in TUD, and also reduced self-reported cigarette craving. These results suggest that brain entropy may serve as a potential biomarker for effects of rTMS, and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying rTMS effects on smoking cessation. Our study contributes to the growing understanding of brain-based interventions for TUD by highlighting the relevance of brain entropy in characterizing neural activity patterns associated with smoking. The observed reductions in entropy following dlPFC-targeted rTMS suggest a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of this intervention. These findings support the use of neuroimaging techniques to investigate the use of neuromodulation therapies for TUD.;,citation_author=Timothy Jordan;,citation_author=Michael R.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is used to study the fluctuations in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at rest, which provides evidence for aberrant brain functional networks in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to examine whether rs-fMRI data could differentiate between PSP and MSA via a multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis of BOLD signals, which estimates the complexity of temporal fluctuations in brain activity. We recruited 14 and 18 patients with PSP and MSA, respectively, who underwent neuropsychological tests and rs-fMRI. PSP patients demonstrated greater cognitive function impairments, particularly in the frontal executive function. The bilateral prefrontal cortex revealed lower entropy BOLD signal values in multiple time scales for PSP, compared to the values observed in MSA patients; however, the functional connectivity of the representative brain networks was comparable between the diseases. The reduced complexity of BOLD signals in the prefrontal cortex was associated with frontal dysfunction. Thus, an MSE analysis of rs-fMRI could differentiate between PSP and MSA, and the reduced complexity of BOLD signals could be associated with cognitive impairment.;,citation_author=Katsuhiko Kadota;,citation_author=Keiichi Onoda;,citation_author=Satoshi Abe;,citation_author=Chizuko Hamada;,citation_author=Shingo Mitaki;,citation_author=Hiroaki Oguro;,citation_author=Atsushi Nagai;,citation_author=Hajime Kitagaki;,citation_author=Shuhei Yamaguchi;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.3390/life11121411;,citation_issn=2075-1729;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Life;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Entropy and the Brain: An Overview;,citation_abstract=Entropy is a powerful tool for quantification of the brain function and its information processing capacity. This is evident in its broad domain of applications that range from functional interactivity between the brain regions to quantification of the state of consciousness. A number of previous reviews summarized the use of entropic measures in neuroscience. However, these studies either focused on the overall use of nonlinear analytical methodologies for quantification of the brain activity or their contents pertained to a particular area of neuroscientific research. The present study aims at complementing these previous reviews in two ways. First, by covering the literature that specifically makes use of entropy for studying the brain function. Second, by highlighting the three fields of research in which the use of entropy has yielded highly promising results: the (altered) state of consciousness, the ageing brain, and the quantification of the brain networks’ information processing. In so doing, the present overview identifies that the use of entropic measures for the study of consciousness and its (altered) states led the field to substantially advance the previous findings. Moreover, it realizes that the use of these measures for the study of the ageing brain resulted in significant insights on various ways that the process of ageing may affect the dynamics and information processing capacity of the brain. It further reveals that their utilization for analysis of the brain regional interactivity formed a bridge between the previous two research areas, thereby providing further evidence in support of their results. It concludes by highlighting some potential considerations that may help future research to refine the use of entropic measures for the study of brain complexity and its function. The present study helps realize that (despite their seemingly differing lines of inquiry) the study of consciousness, the ageing brain, and the brain networks’ information processing are highly interrelated. Specifically, it identifies that the complexity, as quantified by entropy, is a fundamental property of conscious experience, which also plays a vital role in the brain’s capacity for adaptation and therefore whose loss by ageing constitutes a basis for diseases and disorders. Interestingly, these two perspectives neatly come together through the association of entropy and the brain capacity for information processing.;,citation_author=Soheil Keshmiri;,citation_publication_date=2020-08;,citation_cover_date=2020-08;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.3390/e22090917;,citation_issn=1099-4300;,citation_volume=22;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Entropy;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Criticality Creates a Functional Platform for Network Transitions Between Internal and External Processing Modes in the Human Brain;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$Continuous switching between internal and external modes in the brain appears important for generating models of the self and the world. However, how the brain transitions between these two modes remains unknown. We propose that a large synchronization fluctuation of brain networks, emerging only near criticality (i.e., a balanced state between order and disorder), spontaneously creates temporal windows with distinct preferences for integrating the network’s internal information or for processing external stimuli. Using a computational model, electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis during alterations of consciousness in humans, we report that synchronized and incoherent networks, respectively, bias toward internal and external information with specific network configurations. In the brain network model and EEG-based network, the network preferences are the most prominent at criticality and in conscious states associated with the bandwidth 4-12 Hz, with alternating functional network configurations. However, these network configurations are selectively disrupted in different states of consciousness such as general anesthesia, psychedelic states, minimally conscious states, and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. The network preference for internal information integration is only significant in conscious states and psychedelic states, but not in other unconscious states, suggesting the importance of internal information integration in maintaining consciousness. The fMRI co-activation pattern analysis shows that functional networks that are sensitive to external stimuli–such as default mode, dorsal attentional, and frontoparietal networks–are activated in incoherent states, while insensitive networks, such as global activation and deactivation networks, are dominated in highly synchronized states. We suggest that criticality produces a functional platform for the brain’s capability for continuous switching between two modes, which is crucial for the emergence of consciousness.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Minkyung Kim;,citation_author=Hyoungkyu Kim;,citation_author=Zirui Huang;,citation_author=George A.

We studied 89 consecutive admissions to a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit, among whom there were 21 episodes of sepsis, and we performed numerical simulations. We addressed the fundamental issues of optimal selection of m and r and the impact of missing data. The major findings are that entropy falls before clinical signs of neonatal sepsis and that missing points are well tolerated. The major mechanism, surprisingly, is unrelated to the regularity of the data: entropy estimates inevitably fall in any record with spikes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain entropy, fractal dimensions and predictability: A review of complexity measures for EEG in healthy and neuropsychiatric populations;,citation_abstract=Abstract There has been an increasing trend towards the use of complexity analysis in quantifying neural activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG) signals. On top of revealing complex neuronal processes of the brain that may not be possible with linear approaches, EEG complexity measures have also demonstrated their potential as biomarkers of psychopathology such as depression and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the opacity of algorithms and descriptions originating from mathematical concepts have made it difficult to understand what complexity is and how to draw consistent conclusions when applied within psychology and neuropsychiatry research. In this review, we provide an overview and entry-level explanation of existing EEG complexity measures, which can be broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity. We then synthesize complexity findings across different areas of psychological science, namely, in consciousness research, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as changes across the lifespan, while addressing some theoretical and methodological issues underlying the discrepancies in the data. Finally, we present important considerations when choosing and interpreting these metrics.;,citation_author=Zen J. Lau;,citation_author=Tam Pham;,citation_author=S. H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Faded Critical Dynamics in Adult Moyamoya Disease Revealed by EEG and fMRI;,citation_abstract=Criticality is considered a dynamic signature of healthy brain activity that can be measured on the short-term timescale with neural avalanches and long-term timescale with long-range temporal correlation (LRTC). It is unclear how the brain dynamics change in adult moyamoya disease (MMD). We used BOLD-fMRI for LRTC analysis from 16 hemorrhagic ( H MMD ) and 34 ischemic ( I MMD ) patients and 25 healthy controls. Afterwards, they were examined by EEG recordings in the eyes-closed (EC), eyes-open (EO), and working memory (WM) states. The EEG data of 11 H MMD and 13 I MMD patients and 21 healthy controls were in good quality for analysis. Regarding the 4 metrics of neural avalanches (e.g., size ( $\alpha$ ), duration ( $\beta$ ), $\kappa$ value, and branching parameter ( $\sigma$ )), both MMD subtypes exhibited subcritical states in the EC state. When switching to the WM state, H MMD remained inactive, while I MMD surpassed controls and became supercritical ( p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05). Regarding LRTC, the amplitude envelope in the EC state was more analogous to random noise in the MMD patients than in controls. During state transitions, LRTC decreased sharply in the controls but remained chaotic in the MMD individuals ( p $&amp;lt;$ 0.05). The spatial LRTC reduction distribution based on both EEG and fMRI in the EC state implied that, compared with controls, the two MMD subtypes might exhibit mutually independent but partially overlapping patterns. The regions showing decreased LRTC in both EEG and fMRI were the left supplemental motor area of H MMD and right pre-/postcentral gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus of I MMD . This study not only sheds light on the decayed critical dynamics of MMD in both the resting and task states for the first time but also proposes several EEG and fMRI features to identify its two subtypes.;,citation_author=Yu Lei;,citation_author=Yuzhu Li;,citation_author=Lianchun Yu;,citation_author=Longzhou Xu;,citation_author=Xin Zhang;,citation_author=Gaoxing Zheng;,citation_author=Liang Chen;,citation_author=Wei Zhang;,citation_author=Xiaoying Qi;,citation_author=Yuxiang Gu;,citation_author=Yuguo Yu;,citation_author=Ying Mao;,citation_editor=Aldrin Gomes;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1155/2021/6640108;,citation_issn=1942-0900, 1942-0994;,citation_volume=2021;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Increased BOLD Variability in the Parietal Cortex and Enhanced Parieto-Occipital Connectivity during Tactile Perception in Congenitally Blind Individuals;,citation_abstract=Previous studies in early blind individuals posited a possible role of parieto-occipital connections in conveying nonvisual information to the visual occipital cortex. As a consequence of blindness, parietal areas would thus become able to integrate a greater amount of multimodal information than in sighted individuals. To verify this hypothesis, we compared fMRI-measured BOLD signal temporal variability, an index of efficiency in functional information integration, in congenitally blind and sighted individuals during tactile spatial discrimination and motion perception tasks. In both tasks, the BOLD variability analysis revealed many cortical regions with a significantly greater variability in the blind as compared to sighted individuals, with an overlapping cluster located in the left inferior parietal/anterior intraparietal cortex. A functional connectivity analysis using this region as seed showed stronger correlations in both tasks with occipital areas in the blind as compared to sighted individuals. As BOLD variability reflects neural integration and processing efficiency, these cross-modal plastic changes in the parietal cortex, even if described in a limited sample, reinforce the hypothesis that this region may play an important role in processing nonvisual information in blind subjects and act as a hub in the cortico-cortical pathway from somatosensory cortex to the reorganized occipital areas.;,citation_author=Andrea Leo;,citation_author=Giulio Bernardi;,citation_author=Giacomo Handjaras;,citation_author=Daniela Bonino;,citation_author=Emiliano Ricciardi;,citation_author=Pietro Pietrini;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_doi=10.1155/2012/720278;,citation_issn=2090-5904, 1687-5443;,citation_volume=2012;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neural Plasticity;">

These measures can help us identify irregularities and patterns in complex systems. In our study, we utilized fuzzy recurrence plots and sample entropy to evaluate the dynamic characteristics of psychiatric disorders. This assessment focused on understanding the temporal and spatial neural activity patterns, and more specifically, we applied complexity measures to investigate the functional connectivity within the psychotic brain. This involves understanding how different brain regions synchronize their activity, and complexity measures can reveal the patterns of these connections. It provides a means to understand how different brain regions interact and communicate under resting-state abnormal conditions. This study offers evidence demonstrating that fuzzy recurrence plots can serve as descriptors for functional connectivity and discusses their relevance to sample entropy in the context of the psychotic brain.

Functional neuroimaging has been used to assess differences in the mean strength of brain activity in smokers’ brains, however less is known about the temporal dynamics within smokers’ brains. Temporal dynamics is a key feature of a dynamic system such as the brain, and may carry information critical to understanding the brain mechanisms underlying cigarette smoking. We measured the temporal dynamics of brain activity using brain entropy (BEN) mapping and compared BEN between chronic non-deprived smokers and non-smoking controls. Because of the known sex differences in neural and behavioral smoking characteristics, comparisons were also made between males and females. Associations between BEN and smoking related clinical measures were assessed in smokers. Our data showed globally higher BEN in chronic smokers compared to controls. The escalated BEN was associated with more years of smoking in the right limbic area and frontal region. Female nonsmokers showed higher BEN than male nonsmokers in prefrontal cortex, insula, and precuneus, but the BEN sex difference in smokers was less pronounced. These findings suggest that BEN mapping may provide a useful tool for probing brain mechanisms related to smoking.;,citation_author=Zhengjun Li;,citation_author=Zhuo Fang;,citation_author=Nathan Hager;,citation_author=Hengyi Rao;,citation_author=Ze Wang;,citation_publication_date=2016-07;,citation_cover_date=2016-07;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/srep29435;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Scientific Reports;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modular preprocessing pipelines can reintroduce artifacts into fMRI data;,citation_abstract=Abstract The preprocessing pipelines typically used in both task and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) analysis are modular in nature: They are composed of a number of separate filtering/regression steps, including removal of head motion covariates and band-pass filtering, performed sequentially and in a flexible order. In this article, we illustrate the shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of projections can move the data into subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed, reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues can arise in practice when any combination of standard preprocessing steps including motion regression, scrubbing, component-based correction, physiological correction, global signal regression, and temporal filtering are performed sequentially. In this work, we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through application to a test–retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters performed in series.;,citation_author=Martin A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Long-Range Temporal Correlations and Scaling Behavior in Human Brain Oscillations;,citation_abstract=The human brain spontaneously generates neural oscillations with a large variability in frequency, amplitude, duration, and recurrence. Little, however, is known about the long-term spatiotemporal structure of the complex patterns of ongoing activity. A central unresolved issue is whether fluctuations in oscillatory activity reflect a memory of the dynamics of the system for more than a few seconds. We investigated the temporal correlations of network oscillations in the normal human brain at time scales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Ongoing activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded with simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Here we show that amplitude fluctuations of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations are correlated over thousands of oscillation cycles. Our analyses also indicated that these amplitude fluctuations obey power-law scaling behavior. The scaling exponents were highly invariant across subjects. We propose that the large variability, the long-range correlations, and the power-law scaling behavior of spontaneous oscillations find a unifying explanation within the theory of self-organized criticality, which offers a general mechanism for the emergence of correlations and complex dynamics in stochastic multiunit systems. The demonstrated scaling laws pose novel quantitative constraints on computational models of network oscillations. We argue that critical-state dynamics of spontaneous oscillations may lend neural networks capable of quick reorganization during processing demands.;,citation_author=Klaus Linkenkaer-Hansen;,citation_author=Vadim V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spatiotemporal Complexity in the Psychotic Brain;,citation_abstract=Abstract Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health. The measures of resting-state fMRI spatiotemporal complexity offer a powerful tool for identifying irregularities in brain activity. To capture global brain connectivity, we employed information-theoretic metrics, overcoming the limitations of pairwise correlation analysis approaches. This enables a more comprehensive exploration of higher-order interactions and multiscale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in the psychotic brain. In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions. To further investigate these disruptions, we estimated brain network connectivity using redundancy and synergy measures, aiming to assess the integration and segregation of topological information in the psychotic brain. Our findings reveal a disruption in the balance between redundant and synergistic information, a phenomenon we term brainquake in this study, which highlights the instability and disorganization of brain networks in psychosis. Moreover, our exploration of higher-order topological functional connectivity reveals profound disruptions in brain information integration. Aberrant information interactions were observed across both cortical and subcortical ICNs. We specifically identified the most easily affected irregularities in the sensorimotor, visual, temporal, default mode, and fronto-parietal networks, as well as in the hippocampal and amygdalar regions, all of which showed disruptions. These findings underscore the severe impact of psychotic states on multiscale critical brain networks, suggesting a profound alteration in the brain’s complexity and organizational states.;,citation_author=Qiang Li;,citation_author=Jingyu Liu;,citation_author=Godfrey D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain entropy changes in classical trigeminal neuralgia;,citation_abstract=Background Classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN) is a common and severe chronic neuropathic facial pain disorder. The pathological mechanisms of CTN are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) could provide insights into the functional changes of CTN patients and the complexity of neural processes. However, the precise spatial pattern of complexity changes in CTN patients is still unclear. This study is designed to explore the spatial distribution of complexity alterations in CTN patients using brain entropy (BEN). Methods A total of 85 CTN patients and 79 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent rs-fMRI and neuropsychological evaluations. BEN changes were analyzed to observe the spatial distribution of CTN patient complexity, as well as the relationship between these changes and clinical variables. Sixteen different machine learning methods were employed to classify the CTN patients from the HCs, and the best-performing method was selected. Results Compared with HCs, CTN patients exhibited increased BEN in the thalamus and brainstem, and decreased BEN in the inferior semilunar lobule. Further analyses revealed a low positive correlation between the average BEN values of the thalamus and neuropsychological assessments. Among the 16 machine learning methods, the Conditional Mutual Information Maximization-Random Forest (CMIM-RF) method yielded the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.801. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that BEN changes in the thalamus and pons and inferior semilunar lobule were associated with CTN and machine learning methods could effectively classify CTN patients and HCs based on BEN changes.

Previous studies found that bipolar disorder adolescents showed cognitive impairment. The relationship between complexity of brain neural activity and cognition of bipolar II disorder (BD-II) adolescents remains unclear. Methods Nineteen BD-II patients (14.63  years old) and seventeen age-gender matched healthy controls (HCs) (14.18  1.51 years old) were enlisted. Entropy values of all voxels of the brain in resting-state functional MRI data were calculated and differences of them between BD-II and HC groups were evaluated. After that, correlation analyses were performed between entropy values of brain regions showing significant entropy differences and clinical indices in BD-II adolescents. Results Significant differences were found in scores of immediate visual reproduction subtest (VR-I, p = 0.003) and Stroop color-word test (SCWT-1, p = 0.015; SCWT-2, p = 0.004; SCWT-3, p = 0.003) between the two groups. Compared with HCs, BD-II adolescents showed significant increased brain entropy in right parahippocampal gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus. Besides, significant negative correlations between brain entropy values of right parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus and immediate visual reproduction subtest scores were observed in BD-II adolescents.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Individual Cortical Entropy Profile: Test–Retest Reliability, Predictive Power for Cognitive Ability, and Neuroanatomical Foundation;,citation_abstract=Abstract The entropy profiles of cortical activity have become novel perspectives to investigate individual differences in behavior. However, previous studies have neglected foundational aspects of individual entropy profiles, that is, the test–retest reliability, the predictive power for cognitive ability in out-of-sample data, and the underlying neuroanatomical basis. We explored these issues in a large young healthy adult dataset (Human Connectome Project, N = 998). We showed the whole cortical entropy profile from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a robust personalized measure, while subsystem profiles exhibited heterogeneous reliabilities. The limbic network exhibited lowest reliability. We tested the out-of-sample predictive power for general and specific cognitive abilities based on reliable cortical entropy profiles. The default mode and visual networks are most crucial when predicting general cognitive ability. We investigated the anatomical features underlying cross-region and cross-individual variations in cortical entropy profiles. Cortical thickness and structural connectivity explained spatial variations in the group-averaged entropy profile. Cortical folding and myelination in the attention and frontoparietal networks determined predominantly individual cortical entropy profile. This study lays foundations for brain-entropy-based studies on individual differences to understand cognitive ability and related pathologies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Scale-Free Functional Connectivity of the Brain Is Maintained in Anesthetized Healthy Participants but Not in Patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome;,citation_abstract=Loss of consciousness in anesthetized healthy participants and in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) is associated with substantial alterations of functional connectivity across large-scale brain networks. Yet, a prominent distinction between the two cases is that after anesthesia, brain connectivity and consciousness are spontaneously restored, whereas in patients with UWS this restoration fails to occur, but why? A possible explanation is that the self-organizing capability of the brain is compromised in patients with UWS but not in healthy participants undergoing anesthesia. According to the theory of self-organized criticality, many natural complex systems, including the brain, evolve spontaneously to a critical state wherein system behaviors display spatial and/or temporal scale-invariant characteristics. Here we tested the hypothesis that the scale-free property of brain network organization is in fact fundamentally different between anesthetized healthy participants and UWS patients. We introduced a novel, computationally efficient approach to determine anatomical-functional parcellation of the whole-brain network at increasingly finer spatial scales. We found that in healthy participants, scale-free distributions of node size and node degree were present across wakefulness, propofol sedation, and recovery, despite significant propofol-induced functional connectivity changes. In patients with UWS, the scale-free distribution of node degree was absent, reflecting a fundamental difference between the two groups in adaptive reconfiguration of functional interaction between network components. The maintenance of scale-invariance across propofol sedation in healthy participants suggests the presence of persistent, on-going self-organizing processes to a critical state – a capacity that is compromised in patients with UWS.;,citation_author=Xiaolin Liu;,citation_author=B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distributed harmonic patterns of structure-function dependence orchestrate human consciousness;,citation_abstract=A central question in neuroscience is how consciousness arises from the dynamic interplay of brain structure and function. Here we decompose functional MRI signals from pathological and pharmacologically-induced perturbations of consciousness into distributed patterns of structure-function dependence across scales: the harmonic modes of the human structural connectome. We show that structure-function coupling is a generalisable indicator of consciousness that is under bi-directional neuromodulatory control. We find increased structure-function coupling across scales during loss of consciousness, whether due to anaesthesia or brain injury, capable of discriminating between behaviourally indistinguishable sub-categories of brain-injured patients, tracking the presence of covert consciousness. The opposite harmonic signature characterises the altered state induced by LSD or ketamine, reflecting psychedelic-induced decoupling of brain function from structure and correlating with physiological and subjective scores. Overall, connectome harmonic decomposition reveals how neuromodulation and the network architecture of the human connectome jointly shape consciousness and distributed functional activation across scales.;,citation_author=Andrea I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=General anaesthesia reduces the uniqueness of brain connectivity across individuals and across species;,citation_abstract=The human brain is characterised by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain: both with respect to the brains of other individuals, and the brains of another species. We report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organised: it co-localises with the archetypal sensory-association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol, and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that under anaesthesia the functional connectivity of the human brain becomes more similar to the macaque brain. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and meta-analytic brain patterns aggregated from the NeuroSynth engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetised human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.;,citation_author=Andrea I.

Here we decompose functional interactions between brain regions into synergistic and redundant components, revealing their distinct information-processing roles. Combining functional and structural neuroimaging with meta-analytic results, we demonstrate that redundant interactions are predominantly associated with structurally coupled, modular sensorimotor processing. Synergistic interactions instead support integrative processes and complex cognition across higher-order brain networks. The human brain leverages synergistic information to a greater extent than nonhuman primates, with high-synergy association cortices exhibiting the highest degree of evolutionary cortical expansion. Synaptic density mapping from positron emission tomography and convergent molecular and metabolic evidence demonstrate that synergistic interactions are supported by receptor diversity and human-accelerated genes underpinning synaptic function.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reproducible Brain Entropy (BEN) Alterations During Rumination;,citation_abstract=Abstract Rumination, characterized by recurrent and repetitive thinking, is closely associated with mental disorders such as depression. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental state remain poorly understood. In this study, we use a relatively novel neuroimaging analysis method-Brain Entropy (BEN) to quantitatively assess the irregularity, disorder, and complexity of brain activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of rumination. We utilized a publicly available MRI dataset from three different scanners. The dataset included 41 healthy adult participants who completed identical fMRI tasks on IPCASGE, PKUGE, and PKUSIEMENS scanners. The time interval between the two visits was 22.0  14.6 days. The fMRI session included four runs: resting state, sad memory, rumination, and distraction. Whole brain voxel-wise BEN differences of task state and resting state, rumination and sad memory, distraction and sad memory, and rumination and distraction were tested and overlap regions after thresholded (p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.05) across the three scanners were identified as exhibiting significant differences. The results demonstrate distinct alterations in BEN across mental states. Compared to the sad memory condition, decreased BEN was found in the visual cortex (VC) during rumination and decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) during distraction. However, when compared to distraction, rumination showed increased BEN in the PCC/PCu. These findings suggest that rumination involves heightened internal focus and reduced processing of external environmental information.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Systematic Bias of Entropy Calculation in the Multi-Scale Entropy Algorithm;,citation_abstract=Entropy indicates irregularity or randomness of a dynamic system. Over the decades, entropy calculated at different scales of the system through subsampling or coarse graining has been used as a surrogate measure of system complexity. One popular multi-scale entropy analysis is the multi-scale sample entropy (MSE), which calculates entropy through the sample entropy (SampEn) formula at each time scale. SampEn is defined by the “logarithmic likelihood” that a small section (within a window of a length m) of the data “matches” with other sections will still “match” the others if the section window length increases by one. “Match” is defined by a threshold of r times standard deviation of the entire time series. A problem of current MSE algorithm is that SampEn calculations at different scales are based on the same matching threshold defined by the original time series but data standard deviation actually changes with the subsampling scales. Using a fixed threshold will automatically introduce systematic bias to the calculation results. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically present this systematic bias and to provide methods for correcting it. Our work will help the large MSE user community avoiding introducing the bias to their multi-scale SampEn calculation results.;,citation_author=Jue Lu;,citation_author=Ze Wang;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.3390/e23060659;,citation_issn=1099-4300;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Entropy;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of Resting-State Functional MRI Methods for Characterizing Brain Dynamics;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) exhibits time-varying patterns of functional connectivity. Several different analysis approaches have been developed for examining these resting-state dynamics including sliding window connectivity (SWC), phase synchrony (PS), co-activation pattern (CAP), and quasi-periodic patterns (QPP). Each of these approaches can be used to generate patterns of activity or inter-areal coordination which vary across time. The individual frames can then be clustered to produce temporal groupings commonly referred to as “brain states.” Several recent publications have investigated brain state alterations in clinical populations, typically using a single method for quantifying frame-wise functional connectivity. This study directly compares the results of k-means clustering in conjunction with three of these resting-state dynamics methods (SWC, CAP, and PS) and quantifies the brain state dynamics across several metrics using high resolution data from the human connectome project. Additionally, these three dynamics methods are compared by examining how the brain state characterizations vary during the repeated sequences of brain states identified by a fourth dynamic analysis method, QPP. The results indicate that the SWC, PS, and CAP methods differ in the clusters and trajectories they produce. A clear illustration of these differences is given by how each one results in a very different clustering profile for the 24s sequences explicitly identified by the QPP algorithm. PS clustering is sensitive to QPPs with the mid-point of most QPP sequences grouped into the same single cluster. CAPs are also highly sensitive to QPPs, separating each phase of the QPP sequences into different sets of clusters. SWC (60s window) is less sensitive to QPPs. While the QPPs are slightly more likely to occur during specific SWC clusters, the SWC clustering does not vary during the 24s QPP sequences, the goal of this work is to improve both the practical and theoretical understanding of different resting-state dynamics methods, thereby enabling investigators to better conceptualize and implement these tools for characterizing functional brain networks.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Eric Maltbie;,citation_author=Behnaz Yousefi;,citation_author=Xiaodi Zhang;,citation_author=Amrit Kashyap;,citation_author=Shella Keilholz;,citation_publication_date=2022-04;,citation_cover_date=2022-04;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3389/fncir.2022.681544;,citation_issn=1662-5110;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Neural Circuits;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Critical dynamics in spontaneous EEG predict anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness and perturbational complexity;,citation_abstract=Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigate dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. Importantly, all participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams), enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. For each condition, we measure (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related metrics, revealing that states of unconsciousness are characterized by a distancing from both avalanche criticality and the edge of chaos. We then ask whether these same dynamical properties are predictive of the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a TMS-based measure that has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independently of behavior. We successfully predict individual subjects’ PCI values with considerably high accuracy from resting-state EEG dynamical properties alone. Our results establish a firm link between perturbational complexity and criticality, and provide further evidence that criticality is a necessary condition for the emergence of consciousness.;,citation_author=Charlotte Maschke;,citation_author=Jordan O’Byrne;,citation_author=Michele Angelo Colombo;,citation_author=Melanie Boly;,citation_author=Olivia Gosseries;,citation_author=Steven Laureys;,citation_author=Mario Rosanova;,citation_author=Karim Jerbi;,citation_author=Stefanie Blain-Moraes;,citation_publication_date=2024-08;,citation_cover_date=2024-08;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s42003-024-06613-8;,citation_issn=2399-3642;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Communications Biology;,citation_publisher=Nature Publishing Group;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Paradoxical markers of conscious levels: Effects of propofol on patients in disorders of consciousness;,citation_abstract=Human consciousness is widely understood to be underpinned by rich and diverse functional networks, whose breakdown results in unconsciousness. Candidate neural correlates of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness include: (1) disrupted frontoparietal functional connectivity; (2) disrupted brain network hubs; and (3) reduced spatiotemporal complexity. However, emerging counterexamples have revealed that these markers may appear outside of the state they are associated with, challenging both their inclusion as markers of conscious level, and the theories of consciousness that rely on their evidence. In this study, we present a case series of three individuals in disorders of consciousness (DOC) who exhibit paradoxical brain responses to exposure to anesthesia. High-density electroencephalographic data were recorded from three patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) while they underwent a protocol of propofol anesthesia with a targeted effect site concentration of 2 $\mu$g/ml. Network hubs and directionality of functional connectivity in the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz), were estimated using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and directed phase lag index (dPLI). The spatiotemporal signal complexity was estimated using three types of Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). Our results illustrate that exposure to propofol anesthesia can paradoxically result in: (1) increased frontoparietal feedback-dominant connectivity; (2) posterior network hubs; and (3) increased spatiotemporal complexity.

However, long-term changes in neonatal functional connectome lacks an interpretive imaging indicator for the future development due to the non-linearity characteristics. In this study, we introduce an approach to extract intrinsic brain states from short-term brain dynamics to study the long-term (longitudinal) development. We found a high association (r=0.460) between the co-activated pattern of specific brain state and the acceleration pattern of non-linear development of static functional connectome. The fractional occupancy, self-sustaining probability of this short-term state share the similar age tendency with the long-term change rate within the majority of the function connectome.

We assessed relations between brain entropy and plasma psilocin, brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, and a subjective drug intensity rating using linear mixed-effects models. We observed significant positive associations for Shannon entropy of path-length, instantaneous correlation distributions, and divergent associations of sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant effects for 8 of 13 entropy metrics. Brain entropy quantifications showed limited inter-measure correlations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Schizophrenia—An Overview;,citation_abstract=Importance Schizophrenia is a common, severe mental illness that most clinicians will encounter regularly during their practice. This report provides an overview of the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, genetics, neuroscience, and psychopharmacology of schizophrenia to provide a basis to understand the disorder and its treatment. This educational review is integrated with a clinical case to highlight how recent research findings can inform clinical understanding. Observations The first theme considered is the role of early-life environmental and genetic risk factors in altering neurodevelopmental trajectories to predispose an individual to the disorder and leading to the development of prodromal symptoms. The second theme is the role of cortical excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the development of the cognitive and negative symptoms of the disorder. The third theme considers the role of psychosocial stressors, psychological factors, and subcortical dopamine dysfunction in the onset of the positive symptoms of the disorder. The final theme considers the mechanisms underlying treatment for schizophrenia and common adverse effects of treatment. Conclusions and Relevance Schizophrenia has a complex presentation with a multifactorial cause. Nevertheless, advances in neuroscience have identified roles for key circuits, particularly involving frontal, temporal, and mesostriatal brain regions, in the development of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Current pharmacological treatments operate using the same mechanism, blockade of dopamine D 2 receptor, which contribute to their adverse effects. However, the circuit mechanisms discussed herein identify novel potential treatment targets that may be of particular benefit in symptom domains not well served by existing medications.;,citation_author=Robert A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for Maintained Post-Encoding Memory Consolidation Across the Adult Lifespan Revealed by Network Complexity;,citation_abstract=Memory consolidation is well known to occur during sleep, but might start immediately after encoding new information while awake. While consolidation processes are important across the lifespan, they may be even more important to maintain memory functioning in old age. We tested whether a novel measure of information processing known as network complexity might be sensitive to post-encoding consolidation mechanisms in a sample of young, middle-aged, and older adults. Network complexity was calculated by assessing the irregularity of brain signals within a network over time using multiscale entropy. To capture post-encoding mechanisms, network complexity was estimated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest before and after encoding of picture pairs, and subtracted between the two rest periods. Participants received a five-alternative-choice memory test to assess associative memory performance. Results indicated that aging was associated with an increase in network complexity from pre- to post-encoding in the default mode network (DMN). Increases in network complexity in the DMN also were associated with better subsequent memory across all age groups. These findings suggest that network complexity is sensitive to post-encoding consolidation mechanisms that enhance memory performance. These post-encoding mechanisms may represent a pathway to support memory performance in the face of overall memory declines.;,citation_author=Ian M. McDonough;,citation_author=Sarah K.

To address this limitation, we combine principles from the theories of Information Decomposition and Integrated Information into what we call Integrated Information Decomposition, or $\Phi$ID. $\Phi$ID provides a comprehensive framework to reason about, evaluate, and understand the information dynamics of complex multivariate systems. $\Phi$ID reveals the existence of previously unreported modes of collective information flow, providing tools to express well-known measures of information transfer and dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fluctuations in Neural Complexity During Wakefulness Relate To Conscious Level and Cognition;,citation_abstract=There has been considerable recent progress in measuring conscious level using neural complexity measures. For instance, such measures can reliably distinguish healthy awake from asleep subjects and vegetative state patients. However, this line of research has never explored the dynamics of conscious level during normal wakefulness. Being able to capture meaningful differences in conscious level during wakefulness may provide a vital new insight into the nature of consciousness, by demonstrating what biological, behavioural and cognitive factors relate to such differences. Here we take advantage of a large MEG and fMRI dataset of healthy adults, to examine within-subject conscious level fluctuations during resting state and tasks, by using a range of complexity measures. We first establish the validity of this approach in both neuroimaging domains by relating neural complexity measures to pre-existing techniques for capturing transitions of consciousness from full wakefulness into drowsiness and the earliest stages of sleep, finding decreased complexity as participants become increasingly drowsy. We further demonstrate that neural complexity measures in both MEG and fMRI change both within and between tasks, and relate to performance on an executive task, with higher complexity associated with better performance and faster reaction times.

Here, we investigate whether basic characteristics of BOLD signal itself might differ across preterm, term equivalent, and term infants. Anatomical, fMRI, and diffusion weighted imaging data from 716 neonates born at 23–43 weeks gestational age were obtained from the Developing Human Connectome Project. Hurst exponent (H; a measure of temporal complexity of a time-series) was computed from the power spectral density of the BOLD signal within 13 resting state networks. Using linear mixed effects models to account for scan age and birth age, we found that H increased with age, that earlier birth age contributed to lower H values, and that H increased most in motor and sensory networks. We then tested for a relationship between temporal complexity and structural development using H and DTI-based estimates of myelination and found moderate but significant correlations. These findings suggest that the temporal complexity of BOLD signal in neonates relates to age and tracks with known developmental trajectories in the brain. Elucidating how these signal-based differences might relate to maturing hemodynamics in the preterm brain could yield new information about neurophysiological vulnerabilities during this crucial developmental period.;,citation_author=Allison Eve Mella;,citation_author=Tamara Vanderwal;,citation_author=Steven P Miller;,citation_author=Alexander Mark Weber;,citation_publication_date=2024-10;,citation_cover_date=2024-10;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1093/cercor/bhae426;,citation_issn=1047-3211, 1460-2199;,citation_volume=34;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Cerebral Cortex;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Constrained principal component analysis reveals functionally connected load-dependent networks involved in multiple stages of working memory;,citation_abstract=Abstract Constrained principal component analysis (CPCA) with a finite impulse response (FIR) basis set was used to reveal functionally connected networks and their temporal progression over a multistage verbal working memory trial in which memory load was varied. Four components were extracted, and all showed statistically significant sensitivity to the memory load manipulation. Additionally, two of the four components sustained this peak activity, both for approximately 3 s (Components 1 and 4). The functional networks that showed sustained activity were characterized by increased activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left supramarginal gyrus, and decreased activations in the primary auditory cortex and “default network” regions. The functional networks that did not show sustained activity were instead dominated by increased activation in occipital cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, sensori-motor cortical regions, and superior parietal cortex. The response shapes suggest that although all four components appear to be invoked at encoding, the two sustained-peak components are likely to be additionally involved in the delay period. Our investigation provides a unique view of the contributions made by a network of brain regions over the course of a multiple-stage working memory trial.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noise in subsurface hydrology: A review, presentation of fundamental properties, and extensions;,citation_abstract=Recent studies have shown that fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) are useful in characterizing subsurface heterogeneities in addition to geophysical time series. Although these studies have led to a fairly good understanding of some aspects of fBm/fGn, a comprehensive introduction to these stochastic, fractal functions is still lacking in the subsurface hydrology literature. In this paper, efforts have been made to define fBm/fGn and present a development of their mathematical properties in a direct yet rigorous manner. Use of the spectral representation theorem allows one to derive spectral representations for fBm/fGn even though these functions do not have classical Fourier transforms. The discrete and truncated forms of these representations have served as a basis for synthetic generation of fBm/fGn. The discrete spectral representations are developed and various implications discussed. In particular, it is shown that a discrete form of the fBm spectral representation is equivalent to the well known Weierstrass-Mandelbrot random fractal function. Although the full implications are beyond the scope of the present paper, it is observed that discrete spectral representations of fBm constitute stationary processes even though fBm is nonstationary. A new and general spectral density function is introduced for construction of complicated, anisotropic, (3-D) fractals, including those characterized by vertical fGn and horizontal fBm. Such fractals are useful for modeling anisotropic subsurface heterogeneities but cannot be generated with existing schemes. Finally, some basic properties of fractional Lévy motion and concepts of universal multifractals, which can be considered as generalizations of fBm/fGn, are reviewed briefly.;,citation_author=F. J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectories of brain entropy across lifetime estimated by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging;,citation_abstract=Abstract The human brain is a complex system of interconnected brain regions that form functional networks with differing roles in cognition and behavior. However, the trajectories of these functional networks across development are unclear and designing a metric to track the complex trajectory of these characteristics throughout the lifespan is challenging. Here, permutation entropy (PE) was used to examine age-related variations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects aged 6–85 from global, network, and nodal perspectives. The global PE followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory that peaked at approximately age 40. The trajectory of the motor and somatosensory functional network was more consistent with a linear model and increased with age; other functional networks showed inverted U-shaped trajectories that peaked between 25 and 52 years of age. All nodes showed inverted U-shaped trajectories. Using cluster analysis, the peak ages of nodes were grouped into three clusters (at 24, 38, and 51 years). Overall, we characterized four aging trajectories: networks with a linear increase, early peak age, intermediate peak age, and older peak age. These findings suggest possible complexity in trajectories at critical age points regarding changes in related functional brain networks.;,citation_author=Yan Niu;,citation_author=Jie Sun;,citation_author=Bin Wang;,citation_author=Yanli Yang;,citation_author=Xin Wen;,citation_author=Jie Xiang;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=14;,citation_doi=10.1002/hbm.25959;,citation_issn=1065-9471, 1097-0193;,citation_volume=43;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Human Brain Mapping;">

In terms of temporal complexity, these hemodynamic signals have been shown to exhibit critical behaviour at the edge between order and disorder. In this study, we aimed to revisit the properties and spatial distribution of temporal complexity in resting state and task fMRI of 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). First, we compared two common choices of complexity measures (i.e., Hurst exponent versus multiscale entropy) and reported high similarity between them. Second, we investigated the influence of experimental paradigms and found high task-specific complexity. We considered four mental tasks in the HCP database for the analysis: Emotion, Working memory, Social, and Language. Third, we tailored a recently-proposed statistical framework that incorporates the structural connectome, to assess the spatial distribution of complexity measures. These results highlight brain regions including parts of the default mode network and cingulate cortex with significantly stronger complex behaviour than the rest of the brain, irrespective of task.

However, their relationship with the Hurst exponent as a measure of self-similarity is not widely studied. Additionally, ApEn and SampEn are susceptible to signal amplitude changes. A common practice for addressing this issue is to correct their input signal amplitude by its standard deviation. In this study, we first show, using simulations, that ApEn and SampEn are related to the Hurst exponent in their tolerance r and embedding dimension m parameters. We then propose a modification to ApEn and SampEn called range entropy or RangeEn. We show that RangeEn is more robust to nonstationary signal changes, and it has a more linear relationship with the Hurst exponent, compared to ApEn and SampEn. RangeEn is bounded in the tolerance r-plane between 0 (maximum entropy) and 1 (minimum entropy) and it has no need for signal amplitude correction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is resting state fMRI better than individual characteristics at predicting cognition?;,citation_abstract=Abstract Changes in spontaneous brain activity at rest provide rich information about behavior and cognition. The mathematical properties of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) are a depiction of brain function and are frequently used to predict cognitive phenotypes. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and total intracranial volume (TIV) play an important role in predictive modeling of rsfMRI (for example, as “confounders” in many cases). It is unclear, however, to what extent rsfMRI carries independent information from the individual characteristics that is able to predict cognitive phenotypes. Here, we used predictive modeling to thoroughly examine the predictability of four cognitive phenotypes in 20,000 healthy UK Biobank subjects. We extracted common rsfMRI features of functional brain connectivity (FC) and temporal complexity (TC). We assessed the ability of these features to predict outcomes in the presence and absence of age, gender, and TIV. Additionally, we assessed the predictiveness of age, gender, and TIV only. We find TC and FC features to perform comparably with regard to predicting cognitive phenotypes. As compared to rsfMRI features, individual characteristics provide systematically better predictions with smaller sample sizes and, to some extent, in larger cohorts. It is also consistent across different levels of inherent temporal noise in rsfMRI. Our results suggest that when the objective is to perform cognitive predictions as opposed to understanding the relationship between brain and behavior, individual characteristics are more applicable than rsfMRI features.;,citation_author=Amir Omidvarnia;,citation_author=Leonard Sasse;,citation_author=Daouia I.

Our analysis showed that by moving from relaxation to the Stroop color-word, arithmetic, and mirror image recognition tasks, the complexity of EEG signals increases, respectively, reflecting rising brain activity between these conditions.

Strikingly, we found that, despite their low connectivity strengths, these regions exhibited an inordinate role in network integration. Their location and connectivity complexity delineated a specific pattern of sparse interactions mainly involving default mode regions while their connectivity complexity during the awake state also correlated with reaction times during sedation signifying its importance as a reliable indicator of the effects of sedation on individuals. Contrary to established views suggesting sedation affects only richly connected brain regions, we propose that suppressed complexity of sparsely connected regions should be considered a critical feature of any candidate mechanistic description for loss of consciousness.;,citation_author=I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain function complexity during dual-tasking is associated with cognitive impairment and age;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background and Purpose Early diagnosis of cognitive impairment is important because symptoms can be delayed through therapies. Synaptic disconnections are the key characteristics of dementia, and through nonlinear complexity analysis of brain function, it is possible to identify long-range synaptic disconnections in the brain. Methods We investigated the capability of a novel upper-extremity function (UEF) dual-task paradigm in the functional MRI (fMRI) setting, where the participant flexes and extends their arm while counting, to differentiate between cognitively normal (CN) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used multiscale entropy (MSE) complexity analysis of the blood oxygen-level dependent time-series across neural networks and brain regions. Outside of the fMRI, we used the UEF dual-task test, while the elbow kinematics were measured using motion sensors, to record the motor function score. Results Results showed 34% lower MSE values in MCI compared to CN ( p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.04 for all regions and networks except cerebellum when counting down by one; effect size = 1.35) and a negative correlation between MSE values and age (average r 2 of 0.30 for counting down by one and 0.36 for counting backward by three). Results also showed an improvement in the logistic regression model sensitivity by 14-24% in predicting the presence of MCI when brain function measure was added to the motor function score (kinematics data).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spontaneous cortical activity in awake monkeys composed of neuronal avalanches;,citation_abstract=Spontaneous neuronal activity is an important property of the cerebral cortex but its spatiotemporal organization and dynamical framework remain poorly understood. Studies in reduced systems—tissue cultures, acute slices, and anesthetized rats—show that spontaneous activity forms characteristic clusters in space and time, called neuronal avalanches. Modeling studies suggest that networks with this property are poised at a critical state that optimizes input processing, information storage, and transfer, but the relevance of avalanches for fully functional cerebral systems has been controversial. Here we show that ongoing cortical synchronization in awake rhesus monkeys carries the signature of neuronal avalanches. Negative LFP deflections (nLFPs) correlate with neuronal spiking and increase in amplitude with increases in local population spike rate and synchrony. These nLFPs form neuronal avalanches that are scale-invariant in space and time and with respect to the threshold of nLFP detection. This dimension, threshold invariance, describes a fractal organization: smaller nLFPs are embedded in clusters of larger ones without destroying the spatial and temporal scale-invariance of the dynamics. These findings suggest an organization of ongoing cortical synchronization that is scale-invariant in its three fundamental dimensions—time, space, and local neuronal group size. Such scale-invariance has ontogenetic and phylogenetic implications because it allows large increases in network capacity without a fundamental reorganization of the system.;,citation_author=Thomas Petermann;,citation_author=Tara C.

The capability to discern changing complexity from such a relatively small amount of data holds promise for applications of ApEn in a variety of contexts.;,citation_author=S M Pincus;,citation_publication_date=1991-03;,citation_cover_date=1991-03;,citation_year=1991;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.88.6.2297;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_volume=88;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classification of Fractal Signals Using Two-Parameter Non-Extensive Wavelet Entropy;,citation_abstract=This article proposes a methodology for the classification of fractal signals as stationary or nonstationary. The methodology is based on the theoretical behavior of two-parameter wavelet entropy of fractal signals. The wavelet ( q , q $\prime$ ) -entropy is a wavelet-based extension of the ( q , q $\prime$ ) -entropy of Borges and is based on the entropy planes for various q and q $\prime$ ; it is theoretically shown that it constitutes an efficient and effective technique for fractal signal classification. Moreover, the second parameter q $\prime$ provides further analysis flexibility and robustness in the sense that different ( q , q $\prime$ ) pairs can analyze the same phenomena and increase the range of dispersion of entropies. A comparison study against the standard signal summation conversion technique shows that the proposed methodology is not only comparable in accuracy but also more computationally efficient. The application of the proposed methodology to physiological and financial time series is also presented along with the classification of these as stationary or nonstationary.;,citation_author=Julio Ramírez-Pacheco;,citation_author=Joel Trejo-Sánchez;,citation_author=Joaquin Cortez-González;,citation_author=Ramón Palacio;,citation_publication_date=2017-05;,citation_cover_date=2017-05;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.3390/e19050224;,citation_issn=1099-4300;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Entropy;">

Stationarity or nonstationarity determines not only the form of autocorrelations and moments but also the selection of estimators. In this paper, a methodology for classifying scaling processes as stationary or nonstationary is proposed. The method is based on wavelet Tsallis q -entropies and particularly on the behaviour of these entropies for scaling signals. It is demonstrated that the observed wavelet Tsallis q -entropies of 1/ f signals can be modeled by sum-cosh apodizing functions which allocates constant entropies to a set of scaling signals and varying entropies to the rest and that this allocation is controlled by q . The proposed methodology, therefore, differentiates stationary signals from non-stationary ones based on the observed wavelet Tsallis entropies for 1/ f signals. Experimental studies using synthesized signals confirm that the proposed method not only achieves satisfactorily classifications but also outperforms current methods proposed in the literature.;,citation_author=Julio Ramirez Pacheco;,citation_author=Deni Torres Román;,citation_author=Homero Toral Cruz;,citation_editor=Carlo Cattani;,citation_publication_date=2012-01;,citation_cover_date=2012-01;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1155/2012/867042;,citation_issn=1024-123X, 1563-5147;,citation_volume=2012;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Mathematical Problems in Engineering;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Physiological time-series analysis using approximate entropy and sample entropy;,citation_abstract=Entropy, as it relates to dynamical systems, is the rate of information production. Methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. Pincus introduced approximate entropy (ApEn), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. SampEn agreed with theory much more closely than ApEn over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of SampEn statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.;,citation_author=Joshua S.

Sample entropy, an index that captures the predictability of a signal, is a promising tool to measure signal complexity. However, measurement of sample entropy from fMRI signals has its challenges, and numerous questions regarding preprocessing and parameter selection require research to advance the potential impact of this method. For one example, entropy may be highly sensitive to the effects of motion, yet standard approaches to addressing motion (e.g., scrubbing) may be unsuitable for entropy measurement. For another, the parameters used to calculate entropy need to be defined by the properties of data being analyzed, an issue that has frequently been ignored in fMRI research. The current work sought to rigorously address these issues and to create methods that could be used to advance this field.$<$/p$><$/sec$><$sec id=&quot;sec2&quot;$><$title$>$Methods$<$/title$><$p$>$We developed and tested a novel windowing approach to select and concatenate (ignoring connecting volumes) low-motion windows in fMRI data to reduce the impact of motion on sample entropy estimates. We created utilities (implementing autoregressive models and a grid search function) to facilitate selection of the matching length $<$italic$>$m$<$/italic$>$ parameter and the error tolerance $<$italic$>$r$<$/italic$>$ parameter. We developed an approach to apply these methods at every grayordinate of the brain, creating a whole-brain dense entropy map. These methods and tools have been integrated into a publicly available R package (“powseR”). We demonstrate these methods using data from the ABCD study. After applying the windowing procedure to allow sample entropy calculation on the lowest-motion windows from runs 1 and 2 (combined) and those from runs 3 and 4 (combined), we identified the optimal $<$italic$>$m$<$/italic$>$ and $<$italic$>$r$<$/italic$>$ parameters for these data. To confirm the impact of the windowing procedure, we compared entropy values and their relationship with motion when entropy was calculated using the full set of data vs. those calculated using the windowing procedure. We then assessed reproducibility of sample entropy calculations using the windowed procedure by calculating the intraclass correlation between the earlier and later entropy measurements at every grayordinate.$<$/p$><$/sec$><$sec id=&quot;sec3&quot;$><$title$>$Results$<$/title$><$p$>$When applying these optimized methods to the ABCD data (from the subset of individuals who had enough windows of continuous “usable” volumes), we found that the novel windowing procedure successfully mitigated the large inverse correlation between entropy values and head motion seen when using a standard approach.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Biases in the Simulation and Analysis of Fractal Processes;,citation_abstract=Fractal processes have recently received a growing interest, especially in the domain of rehabilitation. More precisely, the evolution of fractality with aging and disease, suggesting a loss of complexity, has inspired a number of studies that tried, for example, to entrain patients with fractal rhythms. This kind of study requires relevant methods for generating fractal signals and for assessing the fractality of the series produced by participants. In the present work, we engaged a cross validation of three methods of generation and three methods of analysis. We generated exact fractal series with the Davies–Harte (DH) algorithm, the spectral synthesis method (SSM), and the ARFIMA simulation method. The series were analyzed by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), power spectral density (PSD) method, and ARFIMA modeling. Results show that some methods of generation present systematic biases: DH presented a strong bias toward white noise in fBm series close to the 1/ f boundary and SSM produced series with a larger variability around the expected exponent, as compared with other methods. In contrast, ARFIMA simulations provided quite accurate series, without major bias. Concerning the methods of analysis, DFA tended to systematically underestimate fBm series. In contrast, PSD yielded overestimates for fBm series. With DFA, the variability of estimates tended to increase for fGn series as they approached the 1/ f boundary and reached unacceptable levels for fBm series. The highest levels of variability were produced by PSD. Finally, ARFIMA methods generated the best series and provided the most accurate and less variable estimates.;,citation_author=Clément Roume;,citation_author=Samar Ezzina;,citation_author=Hubert Blain;,citation_author=Didier Delignières;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1155/2019/4025305;,citation_issn=1748-670X, 1748-6718;,citation_volume=2019;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=LSD-induced increase of Ising temperature and algorithmic complexity of brain dynamics;,citation_abstract=A topic of growing interest in computational neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics and the self-organization of the brain. In particular, the notion that the brain operates near criticality has gained considerable support, and recent work has shown that the dynamics of different brain states may be modeled by pairwise maximum entropy Ising models at various distances from a phase transition, i.e., from criticality. Here we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced and placebo) as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with features derived from the Ising spin model formalism (system temperature, critical point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. We hypothesized, along the lines of the entropic brain hypothesis, that psychedelics drive brain dynamics into a more disordered state at a higher Ising temperature and increased complexity. We analyze resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data collected in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and during ingestion of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Working with the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) brain parcellation, we first create “archetype” Ising models representative of the entire dataset (global) and of the data in each condition. Remarkably, we find that such archetypes exhibit a strong correlation with an average structural connectome template obtained from dMRI (r = 0.6). We compare the archetypes from the two conditions and find that the Ising connectivity in the LSD condition is lower than in the placebo one, especially in homotopic links (interhemispheric connectivity), reflecting a significant decrease of homotopic functional connectivity in the LSD condition. The global archetype is then personalized for each individual and condition by adjusting the system temperature. The resulting temperatures are all near but above the critical point of the model in the paramagnetic (disordered) phase. The individualized Ising temperatures are higher in the LSD condition than in the placebo condition (p = 9  10-5). Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity of the binarized BOLD data and the synthetic data generated with the individualized model using the Metropolis algorithm for each participant and condition. The LZW complexity computed from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship with condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test) and none with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably because of the limited length of the BOLD time series. Similarly, we explore complexity using the block decomposition method (BDM), a more advanced method for estimating algorithmic complexity. The BDM complexity of the experimental data displays a significant correlation with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests that the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics by loosening interhemispheric connectivity—especially homotopic links. In agreement with earlier work using the Ising formalism with BOLD data, we find the brain state in the placebo condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift further away from criticality into a more disordered state.;,citation_author=Giulio Ruffini;,citation_author=Giada Damiani;,citation_author=Diego Lozano-Soldevilla;,citation_author=Nikolas Deco;,citation_author=Fernando E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wavelet-Based Fractal Analysis of rs-fMRI for Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease;,citation_abstract=The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) modality has gained widespread acceptance as a promising method for analyzing a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. It is established that resting-state neuroimaging data exhibit fractal behavior, manifested in the form of slow-decaying auto-correlation and power-law scaling of the power spectrum across low-frequency components. With this property, the rs-fMRI signal can be broken down into fractal and nonfractal components. The fractal nature originates from several sources, such as cardiac fluctuations, respiration and system noise, and carries no information on the brain’s neuronal activities. As a result, the conventional correlation of rs-fMRI signals may not accurately reflect the functional dynamic of spontaneous neuronal activities. This problem can be solved by using a better representation of neuronal activities provided by the connectivity of nonfractal components. In this work, the nonfractal connectivity of rs-fMRI is used to distinguish Alzheimer’s patients from healthy controls. The automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas is used to extract the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series signals from 116 brain regions, yielding a 116  116 nonfractal connectivity matrix. From this matrix, significant connections evaluated using the p-value are selected as an input to a classifier for the classification of Alzheimer’s vs. normal controls. The nonfractal-based approach provides a good representation of the brain’s neuronal activity. It outperformed the fractal and Pearson-based connectivity approaches by 16.4% and 17.2%, respectively. The classification algorithm developed based on the nonfractal connectivity feature and support vector machine classifier has shown an excellent performance, with an accuracy of 90.3% and 83.3% for the XHSLF dataset and ADNI dataset, respectively. For further validation of our proposed work, we combined the two datasets (XHSLF+ADNI) and still received an accuracy of 90.2%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Consciousness and complexity: A consilience of evidence;,citation_abstract=Over the last years, a surge of empirical studies converged on complexity-related measures as reliable markers of consciousness across many different conditions, such as sleep, anesthesia, hallucinatory states, coma, and related disorders. Most of these measures were independently proposed by researchers endorsing disparate frameworks and employing different methods and techniques. Since this body of evidence has not been systematically reviewed and coherently organized so far, this positive trend has remained somewhat below the radar. The aim of this paper is to make this consilience of evidence in the science of consciousness explicit. We start with a systematic assessment of the growing literature on complexity-related measures and identify their common denominator, tracing it back to core theoretical principles and predictions put forward more than 20 years ago. In doing this, we highlight a consistent trajectory spanning two decades of consciousness research and provide a provisional taxonomy of the present literature. Finally, we consider all of the above as a positive ground to approach new questions and devise future experiments that may help consolidate and further develop a promising field where empirical research on consciousness appears to have, so far, naturally converged.;,citation_author=Simone Sarasso;,citation_author=Adenauer Girardi Casali;,citation_author=Silvia Casarotto;,citation_author=Mario Rosanova;,citation_author=Corrado Sinigaglia;,citation_author=Marcello Massimini;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/nc/niab023;,citation_issn=2057-2107;,citation_volume=2021;,citation_journal_title=Neuroscience of Consciousness;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute Alcohol Intake Produces Widespread Decreases in Cortical Resting Signal Variability in Healthy Social Drinkers;,citation_abstract=Background Acute alcohol intoxication has wide-ranging neurobehavioral effects on psychomotor, attentional, inhibitory, and memory-related cognitive processes. These effects are mirrored in disruption of neural metabolism, functional activation, and functional network coherence. Metrics of intraregional neural dynamics such as regional signal variability (RSV) and brain entropy (BEN) may capture unique aspects of neural functional capacity in healthy and clinical populations; however, alcohol’s influence on these metrics is unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the influence of acute alcohol intoxication on RSV and to clarify these effects with subsequent BEN analyses. Methods 26 healthy adults between 25 and 45&nbsp;years of age (65.4% women) participated in 2 counterbalanced sessions. In one, participants consumed a beverage containing alcohol sufficient to produce a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08&nbsp;g/dl. In the other, they consumed a placebo beverage. Approximately 35&nbsp;minutes after beverage consumption, participants completed a 9-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Whole-brain, voxel-wise standard deviation was used to assess RSV, which was compared between sessions. Within clusters displaying alterations in RSV, sample entropy was calculated to assess BEN. Results Compared to the placebo, alcohol intake resulted in widespread reductions in RSV in the bilateral middle frontal, right inferior frontal, right superior frontal, bilateral posterior cingulate, bilateral middle temporal, right supramarginal gyri, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Within these clusters, significant reductions in BEN were found in the bilateral middle frontal and right superior frontal gyri. No effects were noted in subcortical or cerebellar areas. Conclusions Findings indicate that alcohol intake produces diffuse reductions in RSV among structures associated with attentional processes. Within these structures, signal complexity was also reduced in a subset of frontal regions. Neurobehavioral effects of acute alcohol consumption may be partially driven by disruption of intraregional neural dynamics among regions involved in higher-order cognitive and attentional processes.;,citation_author=Landrew Sevel;,citation_author=Bethany Stennett;,citation_author=Victor Schneider;,citation_author=Nicholas Bush;,citation_author=Sara Jo Nixon;,citation_author=Michael Robinson;,citation_author=Jeff Boissoneault;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1111/acer.14381;,citation_issn=0145-6008, 1530-0277;,citation_volume=44;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research;">

A secondary analysis.;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Concussions are among the most common sport-related injuries. While symptoms remain the most widely studied outcome, other measures such as resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) are being increasingly studied to better understand the neurophysiology of concussion. The basis for rsfMRI is the temporal blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which shows complex changes in brain activity over the course of a scan. The BOLD signal can be operationalized in many ways, which effects how the data are analyzed and interpreted. It is therefore important for neuroimaging researchers to understand which rsfMRI metric is most discriminatory between concussion subjects and healthy controls, as such knowledge may aid in the design of future studies. The primary purpose of our study was to employ a random forest approach to determine which BOLD signal metric (of which we selected six) was most discriminatory between concussion subjects and healthy controls. As a secondary objective, we aimed to understand which anatomical regions of interest in the brain were most discriminatory between these two groups. Methods We performed a secondary data analysis of prospectively collected concussion data (n = 28), alongside healthy control data retrieved through an open-source neuroimaging repository (n = 379). After pre-processing data in CONN 21a, six BOLD metrics were computed: mean, standard deviation, Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and fractional ALFF (fALFF). Using a 60/20/20 (training/testing/validation) split of the data, random forest models were built using ’scikit-learn’ and ’imbalanced-learn’ to determine which metrics and anatomical regions of interest were most discriminatory between concussion and healthy subjects. Results We found that ALFF was the most discriminatory BOLD metric, with an ROC AUC = 0.993. With respect to regions of interest, we found that the BOLD signal from the cerebellum, vermis, and putamen (left) were most often discriminatory. Conclusions Our study provides concussion neuroimaging researchers with insight into which rsfMRI metrics may be discriminatory between groups, as well as which anatomical regions may help distinguish between concussion and healthy subjects. This may inform the design of new research studies that take aim at assessing or monitoring concussion using rsfMRI.

Although the confirmation of this hypothesis would mark a significant advance in fundamental understanding of cortical physiology, a natural question arises: What functional benefits are endowed to cortical circuits that operate at criticality? In this review, we first describe an introductory-level thought experiment to provide the reader with an intuitive understanding of criticality. Second, we discuss some practical approaches for investigating criticality. Finally, we review quantitative evidence that three functional properties of the cortex are optimized at criticality: 1) dynamic range, 2) information transmission, and 3) information capacity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neuronal Avalanches in the Resting MEG of the Human Brain;,citation_abstract=What constitutes normal cortical dynamics in healthy human subjects is a major question in systems neuroscience. Numerous in vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that ongoing or resting cortical dynamics are characterized by cascades of activity across many spatial scales, termed neuronal avalanches. In experiment and theory, avalanche dynamics are identified by two measures: (1) a power law in the size distribution of activity cascades with an exponent of -3/2 and (2) a branching parameter of the critical value of 1, reflecting balanced propagation of activity at the border of premature termination and potential blowup. Here we analyzed resting-state brain activity recorded using noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 124 healthy human subjects and two different MEG facilities using different sensor technologies. We identified large deflections at single MEG sensors and combined them into spatiotemporal cascades on the sensor array using multiple timescales. Cascade size distributions obeyed power laws. For the timescale at which the branching parameter was close to 1, the power law exponent was -3/2. This relationship was robust to scaling and coarse graining of the sensor array. It was absent in phase-shuffled controls with the same power spectrum or empty scanner data. Our results demonstrate that normal cortical activity in healthy human subjects at rest organizes as neuronal avalanches and is well described by a critical branching process. Theory and experiment have shown that such critical, scale-free dynamics optimize information processing. Therefore, our findings imply that the human brain attains an optimal dynamical regime for information processing.;,citation_author=Oren Shriki;,citation_author=Jeff Alstott;,citation_author=Frederick Carver;,citation_author=Tom Holroyd;,citation_author=Richard N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wavelet-based regularity analysis reveals recurrent spatiotemporal behavior in resting-state fMRI;,citation_abstract=Abstract One of the major findings from multimodal neuroimaging studies in the past decade is that the human brain is anatomically and functionally organized into large-scale networks. In resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), spatial patterns emerge when temporal correlations between various brain regions are tallied, evidencing networks of ongoing intercortical cooperation. However, the dynamic structure governing the brain’s spontaneous activity is far less understood due to the short and noisy nature of the rs-fMRI signal. Here, we develop a wavelet-based regularity analysis based on noise estimation capabilities of the wavelet transform to measure recurrent temporal pattern stability within the rs-fMRI signal across multiple temporal scales. The method consists of performing a stationary wavelet transform to preserve signal structure, followed by construction of “lagged” subsequences to adjust for correlated features, and finally the calculation of sample entropy across wavelet scales based on an “objective” estimate of noise level at each scale. We found that the brain’s default mode network (DMN) areas manifest a higher level of irregularity in rs-fMRI time series than rest of the brain. In 25 aged subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 25 matched healthy controls, wavelet-based regularity analysis showed improved sensitivity in detecting changes in the regularity of rs-fMRI signals between the two groups within the DMN and executive control networks, compared with standard multiscale entropy analysis. Wavelet-based regularity analysis based on noise estimation capabilities of the wavelet transform is a promising technique to characterize the dynamic structure of rs-fMRI as well as other biological signals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Age-dependent effects of intranasal oxytocin administration were revealed by resting brain entropy (BEN);,citation_abstract=Abstract Brain entropy (BEN) reflects the irregularity, disorderliness, and complexity of brain activity and has gained increased interest in recent years. The demonstrated sensitivity of BEN to caffeine and medicine suggests the existence of neurochemical effects of BEN. Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide associated with childbirth and lactation, affects both social behavior and brain activity. The purpose of this study was to examine whether OT affects BEN in young and old adults. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-factor (Age  OT) between-subjects design was used, and a total of seventy-five eligible healthy participants were included in the experiment. In the young adult group (YA), 23 participants received intranasal OT administration, while 18 received a placebo (PL) administration. In the older adult group (OA), 16 participants received intranasal OT administration, and 18 received PL administration. Using fMRI-based BEN mapping, we found the age-dependent effect of intranasal OT in the left temporal parietal junction (TPJ), where BEN increased in YA and BEN decreased in OA. A whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis with the left TPJ as the seed and we found that FC between the left TPJ and right TPJ increased in both YA and OA.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Altered resting-state brain entropy (BEN) by rTMS across the human cortex;,citation_abstract=Abstract Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method effective in treating various neuropsychiatric disorders, yet its mechanisms are not fully understood. In general, rTMS protocols are categorized into excitatory protocols including high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), and inhibitory protocols including low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS). Brain entropy (BEN) measures irregularity, disorders, and complexity of brain activity, our previous studies have indicated that BEN affects excitatory rTMS, including HF-rTMS and iTBS. However, two important questions remain whether rTMS is equally sensitive to inhibitory rTMS and whether it can induce opposite brain activities, another question concerns whether rTMS can induce specific changes across brain regions. To address these issues, we utilized our own cTBS targeted on the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) dataset and publicly available LF-rTMS dataset with stimulating sites including the L-DLPFC, left temporal parietal junction (L-TPJ), and left occipital cortex (L-OCC), from the OpenNeuro. BEN maps were calculated before and after stimulation. The results showed that L-DLPFC cTBS increased BEN in the MOFC and L-DLPFC LF-rTMS increased BEN in the MOFC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC) and putamen, the regions are consistent with our previous findings with HF-rTMS and iTBS. Additionally, L-TPJ LF-rTMS resulted in increased BEN in the right TPJ, while L-OCC LF-rTMS led to decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Our findings suggest that BEN is not only sensitive to excitatory rTMS but also to inhibitory rTMS. Moreover, LF-rTMS induces different effects across brain regions, as detected by BEN.;,citation_author=Dong-Hui Song;,citation_author=Xin-Ping Deng;,citation_author=Yuan-Qi Shang;,citation_author=Da Chang;,citation_author=Ze Wang;,citation_publication_date=2024-07;,citation_cover_date=2024-07;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1101/2024.07.16.601109;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Neuroscience;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Increased resting-state brain entropy (BEN) in mild to moderate depression was decreased by nonpharmacological treatment;,citation_abstract=Abstract Brain entropy (BEN) reflects the irregularity of brain activity. The neural mechanisms of depression of nonpharmacological treatments remain largely elusive. We employed BEN to evaluate neural changes in mild to moderate depression and their modulation by nonpharmacological interventions. Resting-state fMRI assessed BEN in 29 patients with mild to moderate depression at baseline and follow-up. Among them, 14 received nonpharmacological treatment, while 15 remained untreated. BEN was also evaluated in 20 matched healthy controls (HCs). Baseline BEN differences between patients and HCs were identified using two-sample t-tests. Significant regions were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). Repeated measures ANOVA tested treatment-induced BEN changes in these ROIs. The results indicate that compared to HCs, patients showed higher baseline BEN in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left amygdala (AMY)/putamen, and right hippocampus/parahippocampal cortex (HPC/PHPC). Treated patients had higher baseline BEN in the DMPFC than untreated patients. At follow-up, treated patients showed reduced BEN across all ROIs and reduced depression levels as measured by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In contrast, untreated patients demonstrated no changes and remained significantly higher BEN than HCs across all ROIs. Further analysis showed that higher BEN in DMPFC and AMY/putamen recovered to levels comparable to HCs, though BDI remained higher in treated patients. These findings suggest that bottom-up emotion dysregulation in depression is effectively mitigated by nonpharmacological treatment targeting top-down emotion regulation mediated by the prefrontal-limbic network. This study reveals that BEN can serve as an effective neural biomarker throughout the onset, progression, and recovery processes of depression. Highlights Depression is linked to increased brain entropy in prefrontal-limbic network. Nonpharmacological treatment normalizes elevated BEN of prefrontal-limbic network in depression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurotransmitters Contribute Structure-Function Coupling: Evidence from Grey Matter Volume (GMV) and Brain Entropy (BEN);,citation_abstract=The emergence of human brain function from macroscopic anatomical structures and its relationship with the coupling of structure and function have long been pivotal questions in neuroscience. Neurotransmitter receptors are critical in signal transmission, regulating brain function, and potentially enhancing the coupling between brain structure and function. Recent research suggests that neurotransmitter systems facilitate this coupling between structural and functional networks. However, the mechanisms of how neurotransmitters adapt to local anatomical structures and drive functional emergence are not yet fully understood. This study explores these mechanisms using gray matter volume (GMV) and brain entropy (BEN). BEN reflects the irregularity, unpredictability, and complexity of brain activity, and functional MRI (fMRI)-based BEN has identified its distribution in the normal human brain. BEN is correlated to cognitive and task performance, and aberrant BEN patterns link to various brain disorders. Notably, BEN can indicate neuroplasticity through non-invasive brain stimulation, and pharmacological intervention. We analyzed structural imaging data, as well as 7T resting-state and movie-watching fMRI data from 176 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), to calculate GMV, resting-state BEN (rsBEN), and movie-watching BEN (mvBEN). By integrating data from the publicly available neurotransmitter receptors database, we evaluated the role of neurotransmitters in the coupling between GMV and rsBEN, GMV and mvBEN, and rsBEN and mvBEN.

In Networks of the Brain, Olaf Sporns describes how the integrative nature of brain function can be illuminated from a complex network perspective. Highlighting the many emerging points of contact between neuroscience and network science, the book serves to introduce network theory to neuroscientists and neuroscience to those working on theoretical network models.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ljapunov Exponents, Hyperchaos and Hurst Exponent;,citation_abstract=We consider nonlinear dynamical systems with chaotic and hyperchaotic behaviour. We investigate the behaviour of the Hurst exponent at the transition from chaos to hyperchaos. A two-dimensional coupled logistic map is studied. The application of fractal methods [1 – 6] allows us to explore the chaotic nature of time series. The methods used are (i) the time delay method [embed-ding dimension E, attractor (fractal) dimension D], (ii) Hurst’s rescaled range analysis [Hurst exponent H, attractor (fractal) dimension D], (iii) Ljapunov expo-nents $\lambda$ j (entropy S), (iv) fractal dimensions (capacity, Hausdorff dimension, similarity dimension), (v) non-linear prediction algorithm. The Ljapunov exponents illustrate the bounded dy-namical system’s sensitivity on initial conditions [1 – 6]. Positive Ljapunov exponents of a bounded motion are considered as evidence of chaos, while negative exponents suggest a mean reverting behaviour. The larger the largest positive one-dimensional Ljapunov exponent, the more chaotic is the dynamical system and, conversely, the shorter is the time scale of the system’s predictability. To characterize chaotic be-haviour of a nonlinear dynamical system, the set of the one-dimensional Ljapunov exponents is used. If we have multiple positive one-dimensional Ljapunov exponents, we have hyperchaos. It requires at least a four-dimensional state space in the case of a first order autonomous differential equation. In two-dimensional maps we can also find hyperchaos. Often these dynam-ical systems depend on a bifurcation parameter, and we can study the transition from chaos to hyperchaos. Einstein studied the properties of Brownian motion [7] (Wiener process) and found that the average dis-tance (∆ x) 2 covered by a particle undergoing ran-dom collisions is directly proportional to the square-root of the time ∆t, i. e., (∆ x) 2 $\propto$ (∆t) 1/2 . 0932–0784 / 05 / 0400–0252 $ 06.00 c 2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen $\cdot$ http://znaturforsch.com Hurst [8] (see also [4, 5, 9]) generalized Brownian motion for anomalous diffusion processes using (∆ x) 2 $\propto$ (∆t) H where H is the Hurst exponent. If H = 1/2, the be-haviour of the time-series is similar to a random walk. If H $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 1/2, the time series covers less &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; than a random walk (i.e., if the time-series increases, it is more probable that then it will decrease, and vice versa). Thus values of 0 $&amp;lt;$ H $<$ 0.5 indicate anti-persistent behaviour. If H $&amp;gt;$ 1/2, the time series covers more &quot;distance&quot; than a random walk (if the time series increases, it is more probable that it will continue to increase). Thus a value of 0.5 $<$ H $<$ 1 indicates a so-called persistent behaviour (i.e., one can expect with increasing certainty as the value moves towards 1 that whatever direction of change has been current will con-tinue). The rescaled range analysis R/S (range/standard derivation) developed by Hurst [8] provides a sim-ple tool for analyzing the time series in the form of a so-called Hurst plot. The Hurst exponent H, which ranges between 0 and 1, can be derived as the slope in the Hurst plot, in which ln(R/S) is plotted against ln $\tau$, where $\tau$ is the time step. Given a time series x t : t = 0, 1,...,N - 1, the Hurst exponent can be es-timated [5, 8, 9] by taking the slope (x/s) plotted ver-sus n on a log-log scale. The rescaled range analysis method computes a ratio R/S defined as follows.;,citation_author=Willi-Hans Steeb;,citation_author=Eugenio Andrieu;,citation_publication_date=2014-06;,citation_cover_date=2014-06;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.1515/zna-2005-0406;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Altered Brain Activity in Depression of Parkinson’s Disease: A Meta-Analysis and Validation Study;,citation_abstract=Background The pathophysiology of depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is not fully understood. Studies based upon functional MRI (fMRI) showed the alterations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in multiple brain regions pertaining to depression in PD. However, large variance was observed across previous studies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the results in previous publications and completed an independent regions-of-interests (ROIs)-based analysis using our own data to validate the results of the meta-analysis. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify fMRI studies in PD patients with depression. Using signed differential mapping (SDM) method, we performed a voxel-based meta-analysis. Then, a validation study by using multiscale entropy (MSE) in 28 PD patients with depression and 25 PD patients without depression was conducted. The fMRI scan was completed in anti-depression-medication-off state. The ROIs of the MSE analysis were the regions identified by the meta-analysis. Results A total of 126 PD patients with depression and 153 PD patients without depression were included in meta-analysis. It was observed that the resting-state activities within the posterior cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum were altered in depressed patients. Then, in the validation study, these regions were used as ROIs. PD patients with depression had significantly lower MSE of the BOLD fluctuations in these regions (posterior cingulate gyrus: F = 0.856, p = 0.049; SMA: F = 0.914, p = 0.039; cerebellum: F = 0.227, p = 0.043).

Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in $<$italic$>$discrete$<$/italic$>$ events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Enhanced repertoire of brain dynamical states during the psychedelic experience;,citation_abstract=The study of rapid changes in brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) is of increasing interest in neuroimaging. Brain states departing from normal waking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the aforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by psilocybin (a substance found in “magic mushrooms”) is characterized by unconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time, space and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of these effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic experience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain activity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during and after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo. Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) temporal variability was assessed computing the variance and total spectral power, resulting in increased signal variability bilaterally in the hippocampi and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in BOLD signal spectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively higher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control, and dorsal attention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different connectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a wider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control conditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of the effects of psilocybin on dynamical behavior in the human brain at a macroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the unconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic state.

We studied the link between spatial and temporal correlations of large-scale brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and loss of consciousness and during the subsequent recovery. We observed that during unconsciousness activity in frontothalamic regions exhibited a reduction of long-range temporal correlations and a departure of functional connectivity from anatomical constraints. A model of a system exhibiting a phase transition reproduced our findings, as well as the diminished sensitivity of the cortex to external perturbations during unconsciousness.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of detrending methods for optimal fMRI preprocessing;,citation_abstract=Because of the inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of fMRI data, removal of low frequency signal intensity drift is an important preprocessing step, particularly in those brain regions that weakly activate. Two known sources of drift are noise from the MR scanner and aliasing of physiological pulsations. However, the amount and direction of drift is difficult to predict, even between neighboring voxels. Further, there is no concensus on an optimal baseline drift removal algorithm. In this paper, five voxel-based detrending techniques were compared to each other and an auto-detrending algorithm, which automatically selected the optimal method for a given voxel time-series. For a significance level of P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 10(-6), linear and quadratic detrending moderately increased the percentage of activated voxels. Cubic detrending decreased activation, while a wavelet approach increased or decreased activation, depending on the dataset. Spline detrending was the best single algorithm.

Fifty years on, art theorists recognize his patterns as being a revolutionary approach to aesthetics. A significant step forward in understanding Pollock’s aesthetics occurred in 1999 when my scientific analysis showed that his paintings are fractal. Fractals consist of patterns that recur at finer and finer magnifications, building up shapes of immense complexity. Significantly, many natural patterns (for example, lightning, clouds, mountains, and trees) are also fractal. In this essay, I will present some personal reflections on this relationship between the fractal patterns of Pollock and those of nature, and also on the interactions between art and science as the project evolved. , O mundo da arte mudou para sempre quando Jackson Pollock apanhou uma lata e despejou tinta em uma enorme tela esticada sobre o chão de seu celeiro castigado pelo vento. Cinqüenta anos depois, os teóricos da arte reconhecem que seu estilo constitui uma abordagem estética revolucionária. Um passo importante na compreensão da estética de Pollock se deu em 1999, quando, de acordo com a minha análise científica, suas pinturas eram fractais. Fractais são padrões que recorrem em sucessivos desdobramentos, construindo formas de imensa complexidade. Sugestivamente, muitos padrões naturais (como raios, nuvens, montanhas e árvores) também são fractais.

Here, we empirically identify a mathematically specific critical point near which waking cortical oscillatory dynamics operate, which is known as the edge-of-chaos critical point, or the boundary between stability and chaos. We do so by applying the recently developed modified 0-1 chaos test to electrocorticography (ECoG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from the cortices of humans and macaques across normal waking, generalized seizure, anesthesia, and psychedelic states. Our evidence suggests that cortical information processing is disrupted during unconscious states because of a transition of low-frequency cortical electric oscillations away from this critical point; conversely, we show that psychedelics may increase the information richness of cortical activity by tuning low-frequency cortical oscillations closer to this critical point. Finally, we analyze clinical electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and show that assessing the proximity of slow cortical oscillatory electrodynamics to the edge-of-chaos critical point may be useful as an index of consciousness in the clinical setting.;,citation_author=Daniel Toker;,citation_author=Ioannis Pappas;,citation_author=Janna D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Criticality supports cross-frequency cortical-thalamic information transfer during conscious states;,citation_abstract=Consciousness is thought to be regulated by bidirectional information transfer between the cortex and thalamus, but the nature of this bidirectional communication - and its possible disruption in unconsciousness - remains poorly understood. Here, we present two main findings elucidating mechanisms of corticothalamic information transfer during conscious states. First, we identify a highly preserved spectral channel of cortical-thalamic communication that is present during conscious states, but which is diminished during the loss of consciousness and enhanced during psychedelic states. Specifically, we show that in humans, mice, and rats, information sent from either the cortex or thalamus via $\delta$//$\alpha$ waves ($\sim$1–13 Hz) is consistently encoded by the other brain region by high $\gamma$ waves (52–104 Hz); moreover, unconsciousness induced by propofol anesthesia or generalized spike-and-wave seizures diminishes this cross-frequency communication, whereas the psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) enhances this low-to-high frequency interregional communication. Second, we leverage numerical simulations and neural electrophysiology recordings from the thalamus and cortex of human patients, rats, and mice to show that these changes in cross-frequency cortical-thalamic information transfer may be mediated by excursions of low-frequency thalamocortical electrodynamics toward/away from edge-of-chaos criticality, or the phase transition from stability to chaos. Overall, our findings link thalamic-cortical communication to consciousness, and further offer a novel, mathematically well-defined framework to explain the disruption to thalamic-cortical information transfer during unconscious states.;,citation_author=Daniel Toker;,citation_author=Eli Müller;,citation_author=Hiroyuki Miyamoto;,citation_author=Maurizio S Riga;,citation_author=Laia Lladó-Pelfort;,citation_author=Kazuhiro Yamakawa;,citation_author=Francesc Artigas;,citation_author=James M Shine;,citation_author=Andrew E Hudson;,citation_author=Nader Pouratian;,citation_author=Martin M Monti;,citation_editor=Tatyana O Sharpee;,citation_editor=Timothy E Behrens;,citation_editor=Michael Wibral;,citation_publication_date=2024-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.7554/eLife.86547;,citation_issn=2050-084X;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=eLife;,citation_publisher=eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd;">

Moreover, chaos is predicted to play diverse functional roles in living systems. A method for detecting chaos from empirical measurements should therefore be a key component of the biologist’s toolkit. But, classic chaos-detection tools are highly sensitive to measurement noise and break down for common edge cases, making it difficult to detect chaos in domains, like biology, where measurements are noisy. However, newer tools promise to overcome these limitations. Here, we combine several such tools into an automated processing pipeline, and show that our pipeline can detect the presence (or absence) of chaos in noisy recordings, even for difficult edge cases. As a first-pass application of our pipeline, we show that heart rate variability is not chaotic as some have proposed, and instead reflects a stochastic process in both health and disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Ageing and Sex on Complexity in the Human Sleep EEG: A Comparison of Three Symbolic Dynamic Analysis Methods;,citation_abstract=Symbolic dynamic analysis (SDA) methods have been applied to biomedical signals and have been proven efficient in characterising differences in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in various conditions (e.g., epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases). In this study, we investigated the use of SDA on EEGs recorded during sleep. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), permutation entropy (PE), and permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), as well as power spectral analysis based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), were applied to 8-h sleep EEG recordings in healthy men (n=31) and women (n=29), aged 20-74 years. The results of the SDA methods and FFT analysis were compared and the effects of age and sex were investigated. Surrogate data were used to determine whether the findings with SDA methods truly reflected changes in nonlinear dynamics of the EEG and not merely changes in the power spectrum. The surrogate data analysis showed that LZC merely reflected spectral changes in EEG activity, whereas PE and PLZC reflected genuine changes in the nonlinear dynamics of the EEG. All three SDA techniques distinguished the vigilance states (i.e., wakefulness, REM sleep, NREM sleep, and its sub-stages: stage 1, stage 2, and slow wave sleep). Complexity of the sleep EEG increased with ageing. Sex on the other hand did not affect the complexity values assessed with any of these three SDA methods, even though FFT detected sex differences. This study shows that SDA provides additional insights into the dynamics of sleep EEG and how it is affected by ageing.;,citation_author=Pinar Deniz Tosun;,citation_author=Derk-Jan Dijk;,citation_author=Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer;,citation_author=Daniel Abasolo;,citation_editor=Roberto Natella;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1155/2019/9254309;,citation_issn=1076-2787, 1099-0526;,citation_volume=2019;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Complexity;">

Temporal correlations have shown a dichotomy among these networks: those that engage with the environment, known as extrinsic, which include the visual and sensorimotor networks; and those associated with executive control and self-referencing, known as intrinsic, which include the default mode network and the frontoparietal control network. While these inter-voxel temporal correlations enable the assessment of synchrony among the components of individual networks, entropic measures introduce an intra-voxel assessment that quantifies signal features encoded within each blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. As a result, this framework offers insights into comprehending the representation and processing of information within fMRI signals. Multiscale entropy (MSE) has been proposed as a useful measure for characterizing the entropy of neural activity across different temporal scales. This measure of temporal entropy in BOLD data is dependent on the length of the time series; thus, high-quality data with fine-grained temporal resolution and a sufficient number of time frames is needed to improve entropy precision. We apply MSE to the Midnight Scan Club, a highly sampled and well-characterized publicly available dataset, to analyze the entropy distribution of RSNs and evaluate its ability to distinguish between different functional networks. Entropy profiles are compared across temporal scales and RSNs. Our results have shown that the spatial distribution of entropy at infra-slow frequencies (0.005–0.1 Hz) reproduces known parcellations of RSNs. We found a complexity hierarchy between intrinsic and extrinsic RSNs, with intrinsic networks robustly exhibiting higher entropy than extrinsic networks. Finally, we found new evidence that the topography of entropy in the posterior cerebellum exhibits high levels of entropy comparable to that of intrinsic RSNs.;,citation_author=Gabriel Trevino;,citation_author=John J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using the Excitation/Inhibition Ratio to Optimize the Classification of Autism and Schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Abstract The excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio has been shown to be imbalanced in individuals diagnosed with autism (AT) or schizophrenia (SZ), relative to neurotypically developed controls (TD). However, the degree of E/I imbalance overlap between SZ and AT has not been extensively compared. Our main objectives were (1) to quantify group differences in the E/I ratio between TD, AT, and SZ, (2) to assess the potential of the E/I ratio for differential diagnosis, and (3) to verify the replicability of our findings in a second, independently-acquired dataset. For each participant, we computed the Hurst exponent (H), an indicator of the E/I ratio, from the timecourses of 53 independent components covering the entire brain. Using Random Forest (RF), we ran a classification analysis using the largerof the two datasets (exploratory dataset; 519 TD, 200 AT, 355 SZ) to determine which of the 53 H would yield the highest performance in classifying SZ and AT. Next, taking the ten most important H from the exploratory dataset and the clinical and phenotypic information collected in the replication dataset (55 TD, 30 AT, 39 SZ), we used RF to compare classification performance using five feature sets: (a) H only; (b) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) only; (c) PANSS, ADOS, Bermond–Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ), Empathy Quotient (EQ), and IQ; (d) H, PANSS and ADOS; (e) H, PANSS, ADOS, BVAQ, EQ and IQ. Classification performance using H only was higher in the exploratory dataset (AUC = 84%) compared to the replication dataset (AUC = 72%).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variability of Brain Signals Processed Locally Transforms into Higher Connectivity with Brain Development;,citation_abstract=A number of studies have characterized the changes in variability of brain signals with brain maturation from the perspective of considering the human brain as a complex system. Specifically, it has been shown that complexity of brain signals increases in development. On one hand, such an increase in complexity can be attributed to more specialized and differentiated brain regions able to express a higher repertoire of mental microstates. On the other hand, it can be explained by increased integration between widely distributed neuronal populations and establishment of new connections. The goal of this study was to see which of these two mechanisms is dominant, accounting for the previously observed increase in signal complexity. Using information-theoretic tools based on scalp-recorded EEG measurements, we examined the trade-off between local and distributed variability of brain signals in infants and children separated into age groups of 1–2, 2–8, 9–24, and 24–66 months old. We found that developmental changes were characterized by a decrease in the amount of information processed locally, with a peak in alpha frequency range. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the variability of brain signals processed as a distributed network. Complementary analysis of phase locking revealed an age-related pattern of increased synchronization in the lower part of the spectrum, up to the alpha rhythms. At the same time, we observed the desynchronization effects associated with brain development in the higher beta to lower gamma range.;,citation_author=Vasily A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Small-world and scale-free organization of voxel-based resting-state functional connectivity in the human brain;,citation_abstract=The brain is a complex dynamic system of functionally connected regions. Graph theory has been successfully used to describe the organization of such dynamic systems. Recent resting-state fMRI studies have suggested that inter-regional functional connectivity shows a small-world topology, indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered sub-networks, combined with a high level of global connectivity. In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions, requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give information about a possible scale-free organization of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3&nbsp;Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed. The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.;,citation_author=M.

However, complexity has been defined in many ways by multiple different fields: here, we investigate measures of algorithmic and process complexity in both the temporal and topological domains, testing them on functional MRI BOLD signal data obtained from individuals undergoing various levels of sedation with the anaesthetic agent propofol, replicating our results in two separate datasets. We demonstrate that the various measures are differently able to discriminate between levels of sedation, with temporal measures showing higher sensitivity. Further, we show that all measures are strongly related to a single underlying construct explaining most of the variance, as assessed by Principal Component Analysis, which we interpret as a measure of “overall complexity” of our data. This overall complexity was also able to discriminate between levels of sedation and serum concentrations of propofol, supporting the hypothesis that consciousness is related to complexity - independent of how the latter is measured.;,citation_author=Thomas F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential effects of propofol and ketamine on critical brain dynamics;,citation_abstract=Whether the brain operates at a critical “tipping” point is a long standing scientific question, with evidence from both cellular and systems-scale studies suggesting that the brain does sit in, or near, a critical regime. Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as “dissociative anaesthesia”). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.;,citation_author=Thomas F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Generalized decomposition of multivariate information;,citation_abstract=Since its introduction, the partial information decomposition (PID) has emerged as a powerful, information-theoretic technique useful for studying the structure of (potentially higher-order) interactions in complex systems. Despite its utility, the applicability of the PID is restricted by the need to assign elements as either “sources” or “targets”, as well as the specific structure of the mutual information itself. Here, I introduce a generalized information decomposition that relaxes the source/target distinction while still satisfying the basic intuitions about information. This approach is based on the decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and consequently allows for the analysis of any information gained when updating from an arbitrary prior to an arbitrary posterior. As a result, any information-theoretic measure that can be written as a linear combination of Kullback-Leibler divergences admits a decomposition in the style of Williams and Beer, including the total correlation, the negentropy, and the mutual information as special cases. This paper explores how the generalized information decomposition can reveal novel insights into existing measures, as well as the nature of higher-order synergies. We show that synergistic information is intimately related to the well-known Tononi-Sporns-Edelman (TSE) complexity, and that synergistic information requires a similar integration/segregation balance as a high TSE complexity. Finally, I end with a discussion of how this approach fits into other attempts to generalize the PID and the possibilities for empirical applications.;,citation_author=Thomas F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multivariate information theory uncovers synergistic subsystems of the human cerebral cortex;,citation_abstract=One of the most well-established tools for modeling the brain is the functional connectivity network, which is constructed from pairs of interacting brain regions. While powerful, the network model is limited by the restriction that only pairwise dependencies are considered and potentially higher-order structures are missed. Here, we explore how multivariate information theory reveals higher-order dependencies in the human brain. We begin with a mathematical analysis of the O-information, showing analytically and numerically how it is related to previously established information theoretic measures of complexity. We then apply the O-information to brain data, showing that synergistic subsystems are widespread in the human brain. Highly synergistic subsystems typically sit between canonical functional networks, and may serve an integrative role. We then use simulated annealing to find maximally synergistic subsystems, finding that such systems typically comprise $\approx$10 brain regions, recruited from multiple canonical brain systems. Though ubiquitous, highly synergistic subsystems are invisible when considering pairwise functional connectivity, suggesting that higher-order dependencies form a kind of shadow structure that has been unrecognized by established network-based analyses. We assert that higher-order interactions in the brain represent an under-explored space that, accessible with tools of multivariate information theory, may offer novel scientific insights.;,citation_author=Thomas F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Partial entropy decomposition reveals higher-order information structures in human brain activity;,citation_abstract=The standard approach to modeling the human brain as a complex system is with a network, where the basic unit of interaction is a pairwise link between two brain regions. While powerful, this approach is limited by the inability to assess higher-order interactions involving three or more elements directly. In this work, we explore a method for capturing higher-order dependencies in multivariate data: the partial entropy decomposition (PED). Our approach decomposes the joint entropy of the whole system into a set of nonnegative atoms that describe the redundant, unique, and synergistic interactions that compose the system’s structure. PED gives insight into the mathematics of functional connectivity and its limitation. When applied to resting-state fMRI data, we find robust evidence of higher-order synergies that are largely invisible to standard functional connectivity analyses. Our approach can also be localized in time, allowing a frame-by-frame analysis of how the distributions of redundancies and synergies change over the course of a recording. We find that different ensembles of regions can transiently change from being redundancy-dominated to synergy-dominated and that the temporal pattern is structured in time. These results provide strong evidence that there exists a large space of unexplored structures in human brain data that have been largely missed by a focus on bivariate network connectivity models. This synergistic structure is dynamic in time and likely will illuminate interesting links between brain and behavior. Beyond brain-specific application, the PED provides a very general approach for understanding higher-order structures in a variety of complex systems.;,citation_author=Thomas F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Consciousness as a multidimensional phenomenon: Implications for the assessment of disorders of consciousness;,citation_abstract=Disorders of consciousness (DoCs) pose a significant clinical and ethical challenge because they allow for complex forms of conscious experience in patients where intentional behaviour and communication are highly limited or non-existent. There is a pressing need for brain-based assessments that can precisely and accurately characterize the conscious state of individual DoC patients. There has been an ongoing research effort to develop neural measures of consciousness. However, these measures are challenging to validate not only due to our lack of ground truth about consciousness in many DoC patients but also because there is an open ontological question about consciousness. There is a growing, well-supported view that consciousness is a multidimensional phenomenon that cannot be fully described in terms of the theoretical construct of hierarchical, easily ordered conscious levels. The multidimensional view of consciousness challenges the utility of levels-based neural measures in the context of DoC assessment. To examine how these measures may map onto consciousness as a multidimensional phenomenon, this article will investigate a range of studies where they have been applied in states other than DoC and where more is known about conscious experience. This comparative evidence suggests that measures of conscious level are more sensitive to some dimensions of consciousness than others and cannot be assumed to provide a straightforward hierarchical characterization of conscious states. Elevated levels of brain complexity, for example, are associated with conscious states characterized by a high degree of sensory richness and minimal attentional constraints, but are suboptimal for goal-directed behaviour and external responsiveness. Overall, this comparative analysis indicates that there are currently limitations to the use of these measures as tools to evaluate consciousness as a multidimensional phenomenon and that the relationship between these neural signatures and phenomenology requires closer scrutiny.;,citation_author=Jasmine Walter;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/nc/niab047;,citation_issn=2057-2107;,citation_volume=2021;,citation_journal_title=Neuroscience of Consciousness;">

The purpose of this study was to examine the whole brain entropy patterns using a large cohort of normal subjects. A series of experiments were first performed to validate an approximate entropy measure regarding its sensitivity, specificity, and reliability using synthetic data and fMRI data. Resting state fMRI data from a large cohort of normal subjects (n = 1049) from multi-sites were then used to derive a 3-dimensional BEN map, showing a sharp low-high entropy contrast between the neocortex and the rest of brain. The spatial heterogeneity of resting BEN was further studied using a data-driven clustering method, and the entire brain was found to be organized into 7 hierarchical regional BEN networks that are consistent with known structural and functional brain parcellations.

Compared with controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with (1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, right temporal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula was also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, and brain entropy in the insula and prefrontal cortex, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient versus control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.;,citation_author=Ze Wang;,citation_author=Jesse Suh;,citation_author=Dingna Duan;,citation_author=Stefanie Darnley;,citation_author=Ying Jing;,citation_author=Jian Zhang;,citation_author=Charles O’Brien;,citation_author=Anna Rose Childress;,citation_publication_date=2017-11;,citation_cover_date=2017-11;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1111/adb.12459;,citation_issn=1355-6215, 1369-1600;,citation_volume=22;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addiction Biology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Occupational functional plasticity revealed by brain entropy: A resting-state fMRI study of seafarers;,citation_abstract=Abstract Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been increasingly used to assess brain function. Brain entropy is an effective model for evaluating the alteration of brain complexity. Specifically, the sample entropy (SampEn) provides a feasible solution for revealing the brain’s complexity. Occupation is one key factor affecting the brain’s activity, but the neuropsychological mechanisms are still unclear. Thus, in this article, based on fMRI and a brain entropy model, we explored the functional complexity changes engendered by occupation factors, taking the seafarer as an example. The whole-brain entropy values of two groups (i.e., the seafarers and the nonseafarers) were first calculated by SampEn and followed by a two-sample t test with AlphaSim correction ( p  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05). We found that the entropy of the orbital-frontal gyrus (OFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the seafarers was significantly higher than that of the nonseafarers. In addition, the entropy of the cerebellum in the seafarers was lower than that of the nonseafarers. We conclude that (1) the lower entropy in the cerebellum implies that the seafarers’ cerebellum activity had strong regularity and consistency, suggesting that the seafarer’s cerebellum was possibly more specialized by the long-term career training; (2) the higher entropy in the OFG and STG possibly demonstrated that the seafarers had a relatively decreased capability for emotion control and auditory information processing. The above results imply that the seafarer occupation indeed impacted the brain’s complexity, and also provided new neuropsychological evidence of functional plasticity related to one’s career.;,citation_author=Nizhuan Wang;,citation_author=Huijun Wu;,citation_author=Min Xu;,citation_author=Yang Yang;,citation_author=Chunqi Chang;,citation_author=Weiming Zeng;,citation_author=Hongjie Yan;,citation_publication_date=2018-07;,citation_cover_date=2018-07;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1002/hbm.24055;,citation_issn=1065-9471, 1097-0193;,citation_volume=39;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Human Brain Mapping;">

Recent years have seen an increasing interest in understanding the complexity of these temporal variations, for example with respect to developmental changes in brain function or between-person differences in healthy and clinical populations. However, the psychometric reliability of brain signal variability and complexity measures—which is an important precondition for robust individual differences as well as longitudinal research—is not yet sufficiently studied. We examined reliability (split-half correlations) and test–retest correlations for task-free (resting-state) BOLD fMRI as well as split-half correlations for seven functional task data sets from the Human Connectome Project to evaluate their reliability. We observed good to excellent split-half reliability for temporal variability measures derived from rest and task fMRI activation time series (standard deviation, mean absolute successive difference, mean squared successive difference), and moderate test–retest correlations for the same variability measures under rest conditions. Brain signal complexity estimates (several entropy and dimensionality measures) showed moderate to good reliabilities under both, rest and task activation conditions. We calculated the same measures also for time-resolved (dynamic) functional connectivity time series and observed moderate to good reliabilities for variability measures, but poor reliabilities for complexity measures derived from functional connectivity time series. Global (i.e., mean across cortical regions) measures tended to show higher reliability than region-specific variability or complexity estimates. Larger subcortical regions showed similar reliability as cortical regions, but small regions showed lower reliability, especially for complexity measures. Lastly, we also show that reliability scores are only minorly dependent on differences in scan length and replicate our results across different parcellation and denoising strategies. These results suggest that the variability and complexity of BOLD activation time series are robust measures well-suited for individual differences research. Temporal variability of global functional connectivity over time provides an important novel approach to robustly quantifying the dynamics of brain function. Practitioner Points Variability and complexity measures of BOLD activation show good split-half reliability and moderate test–retest reliability. Measures of variability of global functional connectivity over time can robustly quantify neural dynamics. Length of fMRI data has only a minor effect on reliability.;,citation_author=Maren H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifespan Trajectories of the Brain’s Functional Complexity Characterized by Multiscale Sample Entropy;,citation_abstract=Abstract Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used imaging modality that can capture spontaneous neural activity of the brain. The human brain is a complex system, and emerging evidence suggests that the complexity of neural activity may serve as an index of the brain’s capacity of information processing. In this study we used multiscale sample entropy (MSE) to analyze the complexity of rs-fMRI timeseries of 504 healthy subjects between the age of 6 to 85 years. We constructed the global and regional trajectories of brain’s functional complexity over the lifespan and analyzed its correlation with executive function. We observed a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI-complexity over the lifespan with a peak age occurring at 23 (95% CI 21.27, 26.38 years) years of age. Males reach the peak age of complexity at 26 years (95% CI 19.95, 33.14 years) whereas females at 23 (95% CI 20.16, 29.18 years). We found significant correlations between complexity and Number-Letter Switching of Trail Making Test in parietal and medial temporal lobes while Inhibition and Inhibition/Switching of Color Word Interference Test also revealed a significant negative correlation with rs-fMRI complexity in lateral and medial frontal cortex. These results help to understand behavior of fMRI-complexity with aging and reveals association with executive function of the brain.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monofractal and multifractal dynamics of low frequency endogenous brain oscillations in functional MRI;,citation_abstract=Abstract Fractal processes, like trees or coastlines, are defined by self-similarity or power law scaling controlled by a single exponent, simply related to the fractal dimension or Hurst exponent ( H ) of the process. Multifractal processes, like turbulence, have more complex behaviours defined by a spectrum of possible local scaling behaviours or singularity exponents ( h ). Here, we report two experiments that explore the relationships between instrumental and cognitive variables and the monofractal and multifractal parameters of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired in a no-task or resting state. First, we show that the Hurst exponent is greater in grey matter than in white matter regions, and it is maximal in grey matter when data were acquired with an echo time known to optimise BOLD contrast. Second, we show that latency of response in a fame decision/facial encoding task was negatively correlated with the Hurst exponent of resting state data acquired 30 min after task performance. This association was localised to a right inferior frontal cortical region activated by the fame decision task and indicated that people with shorter response latency had more persistent dynamics (higher values of H ). Multifractal analysis revealed that faster responding participants had wider singularity spectra of resting fMRI time series in inferior frontal cortex. Endogenous brain oscillations measured by fMRI have monofractal and multifractal properties that can be related to instrumental and cognitive factors in a way, which indicates that these low frequency dynamics are relevant to neurocognitive function.

This review presents a comprehensive overview of current evidence from functional MRI studies from the perspective of mood states. We first summarise the disrupted brain activation patterns and functional connectivity that have been reported in bipolar disorder, irrespective of the mood state. We next focus on research that solely included patients in a single mood state for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and research comparing patients with different mood states to dissect mood state-related effects. Finally, we briefly summarise current theoretical models and conclude this review by proposing potential avenues for future research.

Here, we performed a work using permutation fuzzy entropy (PFEN), which has better performance than previously used methods, to analyze the brain complexity of bipolar disorder patients. Based on PFEN research, we obtained brain entropy maps of 49 bipolar disorder patients and 49 normal control, extracted the regions of interest to analyze the complexity of abnormal brain regions and further analyzed the correlation between the PFEN values of abnormal brain regions and the clinical measurement scores. Compared with the values in the normal control group, we found that significantly increased PFEN values mainly appeared in the middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior occipital gyrus and medial superior frontal gyrus, and the decreased PFEN values were found in the inferior temporal gyrus in bipolar disorder patients.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multiscale Entropy of Resting-State fMRI Signals Reveals Differences in Brain Complexity in Autism;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Atypical intrinsic brain activity has been widely observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the temporal complexity of these neural signals remains underexplored. This study aimed to characterise differences in resting-state brain signal complexity between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls using multiscale entropy (MSE). Methods Resting-state fMRI data were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), a large multi-site dataset including 397 participants (179 with ASC, 218 neurotypical controls; ASD: Mean age 16.43 years old, SD 7.17 years old; CON: Mean age 15.75 years old, SD 5.67 years old). Voxel-wise multiscale entropy (MSE) features were extracted across multiple temporal scales. Group comparisons were conducted using voxel-wise t-tests and mixed-effects models to identify region- and scale-specific alterations in brain signal complexity. Results Individuals with ASD showed reduced MSE in prefrontal regions at coarser time scales and elevated MSE in posterior midline regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, at finer scales, followed by a decline across coarser scales. This pattern suggests a shift toward uncorrelated randomness in posterior regions and reduced long-range complexity in frontal areas. No significant associations were found between MSE features and ADOS scores. Conclusions These findings reveal spatially and temporally specific alterations in brain signal complexity in ASD, particularly within the default mode network. Multiscale entropy provides a complementary approach to traditional connectivity and single-scale entropy analyses, offering novel insights into the organisation of intrinsic brain activity in neurodevelopmental conditions.;,citation_author=Wenyi Xiao;,citation_author=Myles Jones;,citation_publication_date=2025-05;,citation_cover_date=2025-05;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1101/2025.05.22.655518;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Neuroscience;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy gradually perturbs the cortex-wide excitation-inhibition balance;,citation_abstract=A bstract Excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is theorized as a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, with a mounting body of previous research focusing on elucidating its cellular manifestations. However, there are limited studies into E/I imbalance at macroscale and its microcircuit-level mechanisms and clinical associations. In our current work, we computed the Hurst exponent—a previously validated index of the E/I ratio—from resting-state fMRI time series, and simulated microcircuit parameters using biophysical computational models. We found a broad reduction in the Hurst exponent in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), indicative of a shift towards more excitable network dynamics. Connectome decoders pointed to temporolimbic and frontocentral areas as plausible network epicenters of E/I imbalance. Computational simulations further revealed that enhancing cortical excitability in patients likely reflected atypical increases in recurrent connection strength of local neuronal ensembles. Moreover, mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed heightened E/I elevation in patients with longer disease duration, more frequent electroclinical seizures and inter-ictal epileptic spikes, and worse cognitive functioning. Replicated in an independent dataset, our work provides compelling in-vivo evidence of a macroscale shift in E/I balance in TLE patients that undergoes progressive changes and underpins cognitive impairments, potentially informing treatment strategies targeting E/I mechanisms.;,citation_author=Ke Xie;,citation_author=Jessica Royer;,citation_author=Raul Rodriguez-Cruces;,citation_author=Linda Horwood;,citation_author=Alexander Ngo;,citation_author=Thaera Arafat;,citation_author=Hans Auer;,citation_author=Ella Sahlas;,citation_author=Judy Chen;,citation_author=Yigu Zhou;,citation_author=Sofie L.

Here, we aimed to address these questions by examining the heritability of brain criticality and its relation to cognitive function by analyzing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 250 monozygotic twins, 142 dizygotic twins, and 437 Not-twin subjects. We found that genetic factors substantially influenced brain criticality across various scales, encompassing brain regions, functional networks, and the whole brain. These genetic influences exhibited heterogeneity, with the criticality of the primary sensory cortex being more strongly influenced by genetic factors compared to that of the association cortex. Furthermore, we combined rs-fMRI data with transcriptional microarray data from the Allen Brain Atlas: Human Brain (ABHB) dataset and found that the organization of regional critical dynamics was highly explained by a specific gene expression profile. Finally, our results showed that the critical state was correlated with total cognition and had a genetic link with it. These findings provide empirical evidence that brain criticality is a biological phenotype and suggest a shared genetic foundation underlying brain criticality and cognitive functions. Our results pave the way toward revealing specific biological mechanisms contributing to critical dynamics and their associations with brain function and dysfunction.;,citation_author=Yumeng Xin;,citation_author=Yue Cui;,citation_author=Shan Yu;,citation_author=Ning Liu;,citation_publication_date=2025-07;,citation_cover_date=2025-07;,citation_year=2025;,citation_issue=26;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.2417010122;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_volume=122;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Avalanche criticality in individuals, fluid intelligence, and working memory;,citation_abstract=The critical brain hypothesis suggests that efficient neural computation can be achieved through critical brain dynamics. However, the relationship between human cognitive performance and scale-free brain dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the whole-brain avalanche activity and its individual variability in the human resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We showed that though the group-level analysis was inaccurate because of individual variability, the subject wise scale-free avalanche activity was significantly associated with maximal synchronization entropy of their brain activity. Meanwhile, the complexity of functional connectivity, as well as structure–function coupling, is maximized in subjects with maximal synchronization entropy. We also observed order–disorder phase transitions in resting-state brain dynamics and found that there were longer times spent in the subcritical regime. These results imply that large-scale brain dynamics favor the slightly subcritical regime of phase transition. Finally, we showed evidence that the neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence and working memory scores are closer to criticality. We identified brain regions whose critical dynamics showed significant positive correlations with fluid intelligence performance and found that these regions were located in the prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, which were believed to be important nodes of brain networks underlying human intelligence. Our results reveal the possible role that avalanche criticality plays in cognitive performance and provide a simple method to identify the critical point and map cortical states on a spectrum of neural dynamics, ranging from subcriticality to supercriticality.;,citation_author=Longzhou Xu;,citation_author=Jianfeng Feng;,citation_author=Lianchun Yu;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1002/hbm.25802;,citation_issn=1097-0193;,citation_volume=43;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Human Brain Mapping;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Decreased resting-state brain activity complexity in schizophrenia characterized by both increased regularity and randomness;,citation_abstract=Abstract Schizophrenia is characterized by heterogeneous pathophysiology. Using multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis, which enables capturing complex dynamics of time series, we characterized MSE patterns of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different time scales and determined whether BOLD activity in patients with schizophrenia exhibits increased complexity (increased entropy in all time scales), decreased complexity toward regularity (decreased entropy in all time scales), or decreased complexity toward uncorrelated randomness (high entropy in short time scales followed by decayed entropy as the time scale increases). We recruited 105 patients with schizophrenia with an age of onset between 18 and 35 years and 210 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Results showed that MSE of BOLD signals in patients with schizophrenia exhibited two routes of decreased BOLD complexity toward either regular or random patterns. Reduced BOLD complexity toward regular patterns was observed in the cerebellum and temporal, middle, and superior frontal regions, and reduced BOLD complexity toward randomness was observed extensively in the inferior frontal, occipital, and postcentral cortices as well as in the insula and middle cingulum. Furthermore, we determined that the two types of complexity change were associated differently with psychopathology; specifically, the regular type of BOLD complexity change was associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas the randomness type of BOLD complexity was associated with negative symptoms of the illness. These results collectively suggested that resting-state dynamics in schizophrenia exhibit two routes of pathologic change toward regular or random patterns, which contribute to the differences in syndrome domains of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Optimized Multiscale Entropy Model Based on Resting-State fMRI for Appraising Cognitive Performance in Healthy Elderly;,citation_abstract=Many studies have indicated that an entropy model can capture the dynamic characteristics of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) signals. However, there are problems of subjectivity and lack of uniform standards in the selection of model parameters relying on experience when using the entropy model to analyze rfMRI. To address this issue, an optimized multiscale entropy (MSE) model was proposed to confirm the parameters objectively. All healthy elderly volunteers were divided into two groups, namely, excellent and poor, by the scores estimated through traditional scale tests before the rfMRI scan. The parameters of the MSE model were optimized with the help of sensitivity parameters such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) in a comparison study between the two groups. The brain regions with significant differences in entropy values were considered biomarkers. Their entropy values were regarded as feature vectors to use as input for the probabilistic neural network in the classification of cognitive scores. Classification accuracy of 80.05% was obtained using machine learning. These results show that the optimized MSE model can accurately select the brain regions sensitive to cognitive performance and objectively select fixed parameters for MSE.

We applied a multivariate approach to identify the pattern of GM and link the structural network to intelligence and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was acquired from 92 healthy individuals. Source-based morphometry analysis was applied to the imaging data to extract GM structural covariance. We assessed the intelligence, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning of the participants and further investigated the correlations of the GM structural networks with intelligence and cognitive functions. Six GM structural networks were identified. The cerebello-parietal component and the frontal component were significantly associated with intelligence. The parietal and frontal regions were each distinctively associated with intelligence by maintaining structural networks with the cerebellum and the temporal region, respectively. The cerebellar component was associated with visuomotor ability. Our results support the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence by demonstrating how each core region for intelligence works in concert with other regions.

As a central part, Basal ganglia play an important role in motor and balance control, but whether its involvement in DPN is unclear. Methods Ten patients with confirmed DPN, ten diabetes patients without DPN, and ten healthy age-matched controls(HC) were recruited to undergo magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) to assess brain structure and zone adaptability. Multiscale entropy and small-world network analysis were then used to assess the complexity of the hemodynamic response signal, reflecting the adaptability of the basal ganglia. Results There was no significant difference in brain structure among the three groups, except the duration of diabetes in DPN patients was longer (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The complexity of basal ganglia was significantly decreased in the DPN group compared with the non-DPN and HC group (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which suggested their poor adaptability.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Altered Complexity of Spontaneous Brain Activity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Patients;,citation_abstract=Background Schizophrenia (SC) and bipolar disorder (BP) share elements of symptoms and the underlying neural mechanisms for both remain unclear. Recently, the complexity of spontaneous functional MRI (fMRI) signals in brain activity has been investigated in SC and BP using multiscale sample entropy (MSE) with inconsistent results. Purpose To perform MSE analysis across five time scales to assess differences in resting-state fMRI signal complexity in SC, BP, and normal controls (NC). Study Type Retrospective. Population Fifty SC, 49 BP, and 49 NC. Field Strength/Sequence A 3 T, T2* weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Assessment The mean MSEs of all gray matter (GM) and of 12 regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted using masks across the five scales. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in these ROIs were also determined and the relationship between the three measures was investigated. The correlations between cognitive assessment scores and MSE values were also explored. Statistical Tests Bonferroni correction, One-way ANOVA, Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r), Gaussian random field (GRF) correction. Results There were decreased GM MSE values in the patient groups (F&nbsp;=&nbsp;9.629, P  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05). SC and BP patients demonstrated lower complexity than NCs in the calcarine fissure, precuneus, inferior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus and cerebellum, and higher complexity in the median cingulate, thalamus, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. There were significant differences between SC and BP patients in the precuneus (F&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.890, P  $&amp;lt;$ 0.05) and inferior occipital gyrus (F&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.820, P  $<$ 0.05). Calcarine fissure, cingulate, temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, hippocampus, precuneus, frontal gyrus, and lingual gyrus MSE values were significantly correlated with both ReHo ( r  $&amp;gt;$ 0.282, P  $<$ 0.05) and ALFF ( r  $&amp;gt;$ 0.278, P  $<$ 0.05).

Objective To investigate resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI)-complexity alterations among children with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), respectively, and comorbid ADHD, ODD, and OCD, within the cool and hot executive function (EF) networks. Design We leveraged baseline data (wave 0) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Setting The data was collected between September 2016 and September 2019 from 21 sites in the USA. Participants Children who singularly met all DSM-5 behavioral criteria for ADHD ( N = 61), ODD ( N = 38), and OCD ( N = 48), respectively, were extracted, alongside children with comorbid ADHD, ODD, OCD, and/or other psychiatric diagnoses ( N = 833). A control sample of age-, sex-, and developmentally-matched children was also extracted ( N = 269). Main Outcomes and Measures Voxel-wise sample entropy (SampEn) was computed using the LOFT Complexity Toolbox. Mean SampEn within all regions of the EF networks was calculated for each participant and hierarchical models with Generalized Estimating Equations compared SampEn of comorbid-free and comorbid ADHD, ODD, and OCD within the EF networks. Results SampEn was reduced in comorbid-free ADHD and ODD in overlapping regions of both EF networks, including the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus, and bilateral caudate (Wald statistic = 5.682 to 10.798, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05 &amp; BH corrected), with ADHD additionally affected in the right inferior/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral frontal orbital cortex (Wald statistic = 7.231 to 9.420, p $&amp;lt;$ 0.05 &amp; BH corrected). Among comorbid presentations, the additional presence of ADHD symptomatology was associated with significantly lower SampEn in every region of interest ( z = -3.973 to -2.235, p $<$ 0.05 &amp; BH corrected). Conclusions and Relevance ADHD and ODD shared common impairments underlying the EF networks in the comorbid-free presentations, with ADHD showing more widespread complexity reduction. When ADHD co-occurred with other psychiatric disorders, the reduction in SampEn extended beyond the regions affected in comorbid-free ADHD, indicating that comorbidities amplify neural complexity deficits.;,citation_author=Ru Zhang;,citation_author=Steven Cen;,citation_author=Dilmini Wijesinghe;,citation_author=Leon Aksman;,citation_author=Stuart B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interindividual Signatures of fMRI Temporal Fluctuations;,citation_abstract=Abstract The complexity and variability of human brain activity, such as quantified from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series, have been widely studied as potential markers of healthy and pathological states. However, the extent to which fMRI temporal features exhibit stable markers of inter-individual differences in brain function across healthy young adults is currently an open question. In this study, we draw upon two widely used time-series measures—a nonlinear complexity measure (sample entropy; SampEn) and a spectral measure of low-frequency content (fALFF)—to capture dynamic properties of resting-state fMRI in a large sample of young adults from the Human Connectome Project. We observe that these two measures are closely related, and that both generate reproducible patterns across brain regions over four different fMRI runs, with intra-class correlations of up to 0.8. Moreover, we find that both metrics can uniquely differentiate subjects with high identification rates (ca. 89%). Canonical correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between multivariate brain temporal features and behavioral measures. Overall, these findings suggest that regional profiles of fMRI temporal characteristics may provide stable markers of individual differences, and motivate future studies to further probe relationships between fMRI time series metrics and behavior.;,citation_author=Shengchao Zhang;,citation_author=Liam J Spoletini;,citation_author=Benjamin P Gold;,citation_author=Victoria L Morgan;,citation_author=Baxter P Rogers;,citation_author=Catie Chang;,citation_publication_date=2021-08;,citation_cover_date=2021-08;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1093/cercor/bhab099;,citation_issn=1047-3211, 1460-2199;,citation_volume=31;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Cerebral Cortex;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A longitudinal study of functional brain complexity in progressive Alzheimer’s disease;,citation_abstract=Abstract INTRODUCTION Cross-sectional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies have revealed altered complexity with advanced Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stages. The current study conducted longitudinal rsfMRI complexity analyses in AD. METHODS Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were implemented to evaluate altered rates of disease progression in complexity across disease groups. RESULTS The LME models revealed complexity of the higher frequency in the CNtoMCI group (those converted from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) decayed faster over time versus CN in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex; complexity of the lower frequency decayed faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions ( p &nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$0.05 &amp; Benjamini–Hochberg corrected with q &nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.05). DISCUSSION Local functional brain activities decayed in the early stage of the disease, and long-range communications were impacted in the later stage. Our study demonstrated longitudinal changes in AD-related rsfMRI complexity, indicating its potential as an imaging biomarker of AD. Highlights We conducted longitudinal resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) complexity analyses using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Higher-frequency complexity in the CNtoMCI group (those transitioning from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) was found to decay faster over time compared to CN, specifically in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex. Lower-frequency complexity was found to decay faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions. This study demonstrated that longitudinal changes in rsfMRI complexity could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease.;,citation_author=Ru Zhang;,citation_author=Leon Aksman;,citation_author=Dilmini Wijesinghe;,citation_author=John M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Resting-state brain entropy in right temporal lobe epilepsy and its relationship with alertness;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background To date, no functional MRI (fMRI) studies have focused on brain entropy in right temporal lobe epilepsy (rTLE) patients. Here, we characterized brain entropy (BEN) alterations in patients with rTLE using resting-state functional MRI(rs-fMRI) and explored the relationship between BEN and alertness. Method Thirty-one rTLE patients and 33 controls underwent MRI scanning to investigate differences in BEN and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in regions of interest (ROIs) between patients and controls. Correlation analyses were performed to examine relationships between the BEN of each ROI and alertness reaction times (RTs) in rTLE patients. Results Compared with controls, the BEN of rTLE patients was significantly increased in the right middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and other regions of the left hemisphere and significantly decreased in the right middle frontal gyrus and left supplementary motor area ( p &nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$.05). The rs-FCs between the ROIs (at p &nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$.01, with the left superior parietal lobule and right precentral gyrus defined as ROI1 and ROI2, respectively) and the whole brain showed an increasing trend in rTLE patients. In addition, the BEN of ROI2 was associated with the intrinsic alertness and phasic alertness RTs of patients with rTLE. Conclusions Our findings suggest that BEN is altered in patients with rTLE and that decreased BEN in the right precentral gyrus is positively related to intrinsic and phasic alertness; the abnormal FC in the brain regions with altered entropy suggests a reconstruction of brain functional connectivity. These findings suggest that BEN mapping may provide a useful tool for probing brain mechanisms related to TLE.;,citation_author=Muhua Zhou;,citation_author=Wenyu Jiang;,citation_author=Dan Zhong;,citation_author=Jinou Zheng;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1002/brb3.1446;,citation_issn=2162-3279, 2162-3279;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Brain and Behavior;">

Here, brain entropy ( BEN ), a data-driven method used to measure the signal regularity of a time series, was applied for the first time to investigate changes in the entire brain at the voxel level. Methods Resting-state functional MRI data were used to investigate insomnia-related BEN alterations and the resting-state functional connectivity (rs FC ) pattern in seed regions with altered BEN in 29 patients with identified and untreated CPI and 29 matched healthy controls. Subsequently, within the CPI group, correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the clinical variables and the BEN and rs FC of the abnormal regions. Results Chronic primary insomnia patients showed significant increase in BEN in the central part of the default-mode network ( DMN ), the anterior regions of the task-positive network ( TPN ), the hippocampus (Hipp), and basal ganglia ( BG ), and decreases in BEN in the right postcentral gyrus (Po CG ) and right temporal–occipital junction ( TOJ ). We also demonstrated that three altered resting-state functional connectivity (rs FC ) patterns were associated with abnormal BEN regions in CPI patients. Correlation analysis identified an association between the altered rs FC and clinical variables, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ), in CPI patients. Conclusions Together, these findings suggest that abnormal BEN -related intrinsic functional plasticity in CPI patients corresponds to poor sleep quality during chronic insomnia. Alterations in both BEN and its affected connectivity may improve our understanding of treatment-naïve CPI patients and promote the future development of new therapeutic strategies.;,citation_author=Fuqing Zhou;,citation_author=Suhua Huang;,citation_author=Lei Gao;,citation_author=Ying Zhuang;,citation_author=Shan Ding;,citation_author=Honghan Gong;,citation_publication_date=2016-10;,citation_cover_date=2016-10;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1002/brb3.529;,citation_issn=2162-3279, 2162-3279;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Brain and Behavior;">

        <p>For decades, fMRI analysis has predominantly focused on linear relationships, such as simple signal magnitude changes and pair-wise functional connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that failing to account for the brain’s non-linear, dynamic organization may lead to incomplete inferences about neural processes. More recently, cognitive and clinical neuroimaging have begun to draw on tools from complexity science to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. Temporal complexity metrics reflect a range of approaches to complexity in time series, including describing the system’s regularity and irregularity, predictability and unpredictability, information compressibility, long-term memory, and fractal patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), applications of temporal complexity are scattered across siloed literatures with varying clarity, which limits accessibility and therefore popularity. This review aims to bridge this gap by communicating the basics of temporal complexity to fMRI scientists. We offer a comprehensive guide to temporal complexity in fMRI, including an overview of fMRI temporal complexity metrics—Shannon entropy, variations of (multi-scale) sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, avalanche measures, and Hurst—followed by a comprehensive review of extant applications in fMRI.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The brain is a complex system that exhibits nonlinear dynamics across multiple dimensions, including in how its activity unfolds over time. Capturing these dynamics requires more than traditional static summaries of average activity or connectivity. Instead, approaches are needed that explicitly quantify the temporal richness of brain function. One informal grouping of such approaches is temporal complexity (<a href="#fig-wordcloud" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). Temporal complexity metrics reflect diverse assumptions and motivations, but broadly aim to quantify regularity and irregularity in time series, including features like recurring patterns, memory, and unpredictability <span class="citation" data-cites="varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020">(<a href="#ref-varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020" role="doc-biblioref">Varley, Luppi, et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Temporal complexity is the most common of the complex-systems approaches to the brain (e.g., see <span class="citation" data-cites="sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020">Sun et al. (<a href="#ref-sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> for a domain-specific review (Alzheimer’s)), and is present across scales (<a href="#fig-scales" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>), from the cellular to large-scale functional networks <span class="citation" data-cites="cofreEntropyComplexityTools2025">(<a href="#ref-cofreEntropyComplexityTools2025" role="doc-biblioref">Cofré et al. 2025</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indirectly assess temporal complexity in brain activity through the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Despite the fact that fMRI is traditionally considered unsuitable for rigorous temporal analyses — its time series are sampled slowly (0.5–3 s), and are relatively short in length (5–10 minutes), limiting access to fine-scale dynamics and data-hungry metrics <span class="citation" data-cites="grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016">(<a href="#ref-grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016" role="doc-biblioref">Grandy et al. 2016</a>)</span> — a growing literature shows that coarse-scale dynamics remain informative. These dynamics have been linked to both cognitive and clinical states and have be reliably characterized using fMRI recordings <span class="citation" data-cites="sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016 xinApplicationComplexityAnalysis2021">(<a href="#ref-sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016" role="doc-biblioref">Moses O.

<p>Compared to other neuroimaging modalities (reviewed in <span class="citation" data-cites="sarassoConsciousnessComplexityConsilience2021 sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020 hernandezBrainComplexityPsychiatric2023 keshmiriEntropyBrainOverview2020 yangMentalIllnessComplex2013">(<a href="#ref-sarassoConsciousnessComplexityConsilience2021" role="doc-biblioref">Sarasso et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020" role="doc-biblioref">Sun et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-hernandezBrainComplexityPsychiatric2023" role="doc-biblioref">Hernández et al. 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-keshmiriEntropyBrainOverview2020" role="doc-biblioref">Keshmiri 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-yangMentalIllnessComplex2013" role="doc-biblioref">A. C. Yang and Tsai 2013</a>)</span>), however, temporal complexity metrics are seldom used in fMRI research. This is reflected in a diffuse, unstandardized landscape in which methods are siloed across research groups, limiting accessibility and comparability. The present review aims to help bridge this gap. Going beyond previous reviews of complexity in fMRI [<span class="citation" data-cites="sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016">Moses O. Sokunbi (<a href="#ref-sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>; xinApplicationComplexityAnalysis2021], we have attempted to systematically identify all temporal complexity metrics used in fMRI research and all relevant papers that used each metric. To our knowledge, no prior review has undertaken this task at this scope.</p>
<p>This review also differs from previous reviews in its primary aim. Rather than summarize prior clinical and neuroscience findings (although we do include this as well), we have focused on providing guidance for clinical and cognitive researchers who wish to implement temporal complexity metrics. Many such researchers lack a background in information theory and thus face a choice: either apply temporal complexity measures without fully understanding the theoretical context — risking methodological or interpretational errors — or invest considerable time learning about a vast, interdisciplinary, and technically varied literature. Our review aims to solve this problem by serving as both a comprehensive and accessible resource for temporal complexity methods in fMRI.</p>
<!-- TODO: Describe the sections you are about to review -->
<p>What follows is first a review of the basic concepts of various temporal complexity metrics and the history of their applications to fMRI, followed by a comparison of these metrics, and finally a discussion that explores their clinical and neuroscience findings. ## What is complexity?</p>
<p>Complexity is conceptualized as involving a balance between order and disorder <span class="citation" data-cites="spornsNetworksBrain2010">(<a href="#ref-spornsNetworksBrain2010" role="doc-biblioref">Sporns 2010</a>)</span>. Uniform systems (e.g., crystal lattices; sine waves) are not complex, nor are completely irregular ones (e.g., randomly moving particles; white noise); rather, complexity lies between these two extremes, combining predictability and unpredictability <span class="citation" data-cites="varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020">(<a href="#ref-varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020" role="doc-biblioref">Varley, Luppi, et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="variability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variability">Variability</h2>
<p>In order to get a sense of temporal complexity, it may help to first describe how it differs from variability. Complexity and variability are statistically distinct, yet closely intertwined. Temporal complexity and variability both describe the temporal dynamics of neurophysiological signal, with variability describing signal spread, and complexity describing within-series interactions and recurring patterns (<a href="#fig-variability" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). A time series that is more complex is not necessarily more variable, and vice versa. Indeed, some measures of complexity explicitly make use of variability as a measure across different scales (e.g., Approximate entropy <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span> or Rescaled range to measure the Hurst exponent <span class="citation" data-cites="hurstLongTermStorageCapacity1951">(<a href="#ref-hurstLongTermStorageCapacity1951" role="doc-biblioref">Hurst 1951</a>)</span>). Nevertheless, complexity and variability are closely related. Across theoretical perspectives, changes in a system (i.e.&nbsp;it’s variance) are fundamentally related to the complexity of its behaviour <span class="citation" data-cites="lotfiStatisticalComplexityMaximized2021 garrettMomenttomomentBrainSignal2013 chialvoLifeEdgeComplexity2018 heScaleFreePropertiesFunctional2011">(<a href="#ref-lotfiStatisticalComplexityMaximized2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lotfi et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-garrettMomenttomomentBrainSignal2013" role="doc-biblioref">Garrett et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-chialvoLifeEdgeComplexity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chialvo 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-heScaleFreePropertiesFunctional2011" role="doc-biblioref">He 2011</a>)</span>. Intuitively, a system cannot exhibit complex behaviour if its variability is either minimal or maximal — that is, if it is in complete stasis or fluctuates completely randomly.</p>

<!-- There is a growing literature on signal variability. Briefly: Variability is essential to brain function (Garrett et al., 2013; Baracchini et al., 2023). Measures of temporal signal variability are relevant to cognition, lifespan development, and disease (Steinberg & King, 2024; Goodman et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023). These measures include variance (He, 2011), standard deviation (SD; the square root of the variance; Garrett et al., 2010), and mean square successive differences (similar to variance, but comparisons are made between adjacent timepoints in the series; Leo et al., 2012; Afyouni & Nichols, 2018). -->
<p><!-- From a complex-systems perspective, complexity relies on a particular degree of variability, with both minimal variability (i.e., complete order) and maximal variability (i.e., complete randomness) being associated with low complexity (e.g., Lofti et al., 2021; Garrett et al., 2013; Chialvo, 2018; He, 2011; Steinberg & King, 2024; Goodman et al., 2024). Note that the terms complexity and variability are nonetheless sometimes used interchangeably (e.g., Jaworska et al., 2018).--></p>

<p>Entropy, in the context of time-series and brain signals, is a measure of uncertainty, irregularity, or unpredictability in a signal. It originates from information theory and statistical mechanics, but has been adapted into many specialized forms for analyzing neural dynamics.

<p>Shannon entropy serves as the foundation for virtually all contemporary entropy measures, and its introduction marked the birth of information theory <span class="citation" data-cites="shannonCommunicationPresenceNoise1949">(<a href="#ref-shannonCommunicationPresenceNoise1949" role="doc-biblioref">Shannon 1949</a>)</span>. Shannon entropy quantifies uncertainty; it can be thought of as the difficulty of predicting an observation’s value (<a href="#fig-entropyuncertainty" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). Applied to a time series, it measures the minimum number of ‘bits’ needed to encode the series based on the frequency of values (<a href="#fig-entropybolddistribution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>).</p>

<p>Shannon entropy can be calculated using the following equation:</p>
<p><span id="eq-shannonentropy"><span class="math display">\[
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\log(p_{i})
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is entropy and <span class="math inline">\(p_{i}\)</span> is the frequency of a given value.</p>
<!-- TODO: might need to distinguish frequency from probability and wavelengths -->
<p>Shannon entropy is seldom used to assess the temporal complexity of neuroimaging time series. Instead, it is most commonly applied to spatiotemporal properties—for example, to quantify the complexity of functional connectivity (FC) <span class="citation" data-cites="violShannonEntropyBrain2017 pappasBrainNetworkDisintegration2019">(<a href="#ref-violShannonEntropyBrain2017" role="doc-biblioref">Viol et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-pappasBrainNetworkDisintegration2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pappas et al. 2019</a>)</span>. This is because the classic formulation only considers frequency values, not their order. The resulting metric is poorly suited to describe how a series changes over time. Only one study, by <span class="citation" data-cites="huangDefaultModeNetwork2025">Huang et al. (<a href="#ref-huangDefaultModeNetwork2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span>, used Shannon entropy of frequency of values (details in discussion). However, several studies have applied Shannon entropy to wavelet-decomposed time series (i.e., analyzing the entropy of different frequency bins; method described in <span class="citation" data-cites="rossoWaveletEntropyNew2001">Rosso et al. (<a href="#ref-rossoWaveletEntropyNew2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>), which has been shown to be an improvement over the classic formulation. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="guptaWaveletEntropyBOLD2017">Gupta et al. (<a href="#ref-guptaWaveletEntropyBOLD2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> found that Shannon wavelet entropy was able to discriminate epilepsy patients from controls, whereas classical Shannon entropy was not.</p>
<p>Although Shannon entropy is rarely applied with the explicit aim of describing temporal complexity, it has been used as an innovative alternative to traditional methods of analyzing event-related fMRI data. Unlike traditional methods, entropy makes no assumptions about the shape of the evoked hemodynamic response, which can improve stability and sensitivity <span class="citation" data-cites="mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012 ostwaldInformationTheoreticApproaches2011">(<a href="#ref-mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012" role="doc-biblioref">Mikoláš et al. 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-ostwaldInformationTheoreticApproaches2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ostwald and Bagshaw 2011</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003">De Araujo et al. (<a href="#ref-dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> were the first to apply Shannon entropy to event-related fMRI analysis. They calculated entropy within time windows during activation and rest; the rise and fall of the entropy measure mirrored the theoretical hemodynamic response (<a href="#fig-shannonentropyevents" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). Compared to traditional cross-correlation, Shannon entropy was more stable with a changing signal-to-noise ratio <span class="citation" data-cites="dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003">(<a href="#ref-dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003" role="doc-biblioref">De Araujo et al. 2003</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dinuzzoTemporalInformationEntropy2017">DiNuzzo et al. (<a href="#ref-dinuzzoTemporalInformationEntropy2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> also used Shannon entropy in event-related analysis, which allowed them to capture changes induced by photic stimulation that were missed by traditional temporal descriptors (e.g., variance). Together, these results indicate that Shannon entropy may capture features of BOLD dynamics that escape conventional temporal measures. More broadly, this demonstrates the usefulness of temporal dynamics in situations where spatial maps are unable to fully capture condition differences.</p>

<p>Several extensions to Shannon entropy have been introduced as alternatives to conventional methods for discriminating task conditions in event-related fMRI.

(<a href="#ref-mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, nor in the decade since. This may be because of their high computational demands or simply because there are better approaches to model-free hemodynamic response estimation (e.g., finite-impulse-response models <span class="citation" data-cites="metzakConstrainedPrincipalComponent2011">(<a href="#ref-metzakConstrainedPrincipalComponent2011" role="doc-biblioref">Metzak et al. 2011</a>)</span>. No studies have systematically evaluated whether Shannon-entropy-based analysis methods discriminate task conditions better than conventional ones, which leaves a knowledge gap.</p>

<p>In contrast to Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy takes time into account (<a href="#fig-ksentropy" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>), allowing for application to dynamical systems <span class="citation" data-cites="nogueiraExploringLinkMultiscale2017">(<a href="#ref-nogueiraExploringLinkMultiscale2017" role="doc-biblioref">Nogueira 2017</a>)</span>. As a system evolves, KS entropy quantifies the average rate at which information is produced with each new state; that is, it quantifies the difficulty of predicting future observations given past observations. Higher KS entropy implies that a higher amount of information is being introduced at each time point, meaning that the series is more unpredictable. Like Shannon entropy, KS entropy implements the intuitive notion that a broader distribution of data values should correspond to greater uncertainty.</p>

<p>KS entropy is difficult to apply to real-world data, given that proper implementation requires exceedingly large amounts of time series data and an absence of noise <span class="citation" data-cites="pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991 richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991" role="doc-biblioref">Pincus 1991</a>; <a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. As such, a variety of measures have been developed as approximations for KS entropy. The following sections discuss approximations of KS entropy that have been applied to fMRI research.</p>
</section>
<section id="approximate-entropy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approximate-entropy">Approximate entropy</h3>
<p>In fMRI, nearly all approximations of KS entropy can trace their historical lineage to approximate entropy (ApEn) <span class="citation" data-cites="pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991">(<a href="#ref-pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991" role="doc-biblioref">Pincus 1991</a>)</span>. First used on cardiovascular time series and later adapted for neuroimaging <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000 bruhnApproximateEntropyElectroencephalographic2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-bruhnApproximateEntropyElectroencephalographic2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bruhn, Röpcke, and Hoeft 2000</a>)</span>, ApEn quantifies the probability that sequences of similar patterns in a time series will remain similar when sequence length is increased. A higher value of ApEn signifies that the signal contains fewer repeating patterns—that is, greater complexity.</p>
<!-- TODO: why see Sample Entropy? -->
<p>In the calculation of ApEn, each sequence is counted as matching itself <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. This nuance leads to two limitations. First, it causes ApEn to be lower than expected for shorter time series <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. This is because counting self-matches inflates the estimation of regularity, and this over-inflation is more prominent for short series. Shortening datasets (e.g., by using one fMRI run instead of two) may change ApEn despite identical patterns. Second, ApEn lacks relative consistency, meaning that comparisons between datasets can be affected by the choice of time-window and tolerance parameters (i.e., if ApEn is higher for one dataset than another using one set of parameters, we would expect this to remain true for other choices of parameters, but this is not the case; <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Given these limitations, ApEn is rarely used to characterize temporal complexity in fMRI. In most fMRI studies, ApEn is reported only alongside other entropy-based measures — such as sample entropy (SE) or fuzzy approximate entropy — and therefore these applications are included in our “Comparisons of All Metrics” section. Two ApEn studies that do not appear in that section are <span class="citation" data-cites="sokunbiInterindividualDifferencesFMRI2011">M. O. Sokunbi et al. (<a href="#ref-sokunbiInterindividualDifferencesFMRI2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="liuComplexitySynchronicityResting2013">C. Y. Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-liuComplexitySynchronicityResting2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; both report clinical findings that align with the broader complexity literature, and we summarize these in the Discussion.</p>
</section>
<section id="sample-entropy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sample-entropy">Sample entropy</h3>
<p>Sample entropy (SE) was developed to correct ApEn’s limitations <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. The difference between the calculation of SE and that of ApEn is that SE doesn’t count self-matches in the conditional probability, which corrects the two limitations described in the ApEn section <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span> (for an example in fMRI, see <span class="citation" data-cites="yangStrategyReduceBias2018">(<a href="#ref-yangStrategyReduceBias2018" role="doc-biblioref">A. C. Yang et al. 2018</a>)</span>. In addition to these advantages, SE is a better approximation of KS entropy and is simpler to compute <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. Accordingly, SE is more widely used than ApEn in fMRI and can be computed using the toolboxes <code>BENtbx</code> <a href="https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx">https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx; e.g., Wang et al., 2014</a> (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="wangBrainEntropyMapping2014">Z.

Zhang et al. (<a href="#ref-zhangAlteredComplexitySpontaneous2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>). SE is most often called “brain entropy” (BEN) <span class="citation" data-cites="wangBrainEntropyMapping2014">(<a href="#ref-wangBrainEntropyMapping2014" role="doc-biblioref">Z. Wang et al. 2014</a>)</span>; however, because BEN can also refer to Shannon entropy <span class="citation" data-cites="akdenizComplexityAnalysisRestingState2017">(<a href="#ref-akdenizComplexityAnalysisRestingState2017" role="doc-biblioref">Akdeniz 2017</a>)</span>, we elected to use the term SE in this review.</p>
<p>To calculate SE, the user specifies two parameters: the time window <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and the tolerance scale <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the number of values to be analysed at a time, and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the multiplied by the standard deviation (SD) of the series to obtain the tolerance. SE is equal to the negative average natural logarithm of the conditional probability that two sequences that are similar (i.e., within the tolerance) for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> points will stay similar for <span class="math inline">\(m+1\)</span> points <span class="citation" data-cites="richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000">(<a href="#ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" role="doc-biblioref">Richman and Moorman 2000</a>)</span>. Because conditional probability is between 0 and 1, SE will always be positive. When the time series is highly regular (i.e., when similar runs remain similar), SE is low; when the time series is irregular, SE is high <span class="citation" data-cites="pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991">(<a href="#ref-pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991" role="doc-biblioref">Pincus 1991</a>)</span>.

<p>Several innovations to SE have been made in recent years. <span class="citation" data-cites="delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024">G. Del Mauro and Wang (<a href="#ref-delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> introduced “cross” SE, a method for comparing multiple SE maps which can be applied to make comparisons between subjects, sessions, scan times, or regions. Thus far, cross entropy has been used to show a decoupling between the (across-subject) mean and variance of SE across different brain regions <span class="citation" data-cites="delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024">(<a href="#ref-delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024" role="doc-biblioref">G. Del Mauro and Wang 2024</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021">Z. Wang (<a href="#ref-wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> pioneered dynamic SE, wherein SE is estimated for every segment of a sliding window. Despite its name, dynamic SE is not designed to be used to track changes in SE over the course of a run; instead, SE for each segment is combined into a final run mean. In a sample of 862 subjects, <span class="citation" data-cites="wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021">Z. Wang (<a href="#ref-wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> found minimal differences between static (traditional) and dynamic SE.</p>

<p>The entropy-based metrics discussed thus far — Shannon entropy, KS entropy, ApEn, and SE — are maximized with maximum randomness (<a href="#fig-entropymonotonic" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>). That is, these metrics are formulated to increase monotonically with series randomness. Contrast this with the definition we described at the beginning, where complexity is a balance of regularity and irregularity, the “ideal” complexity metric should be maximized at an intermediate point these two extremes. Therefore, strictly speaking, despite being the most commonly used metrics, ApEn and SE do not truly capture “complexity.”</p>

<p>How much of a limitation is this? We are reluctant to dismiss the breadth of good work that has already been completed; in our view, the conflation of complexity and irregularity is only a limitation if, at the scale under investigation, the comparison involves shifts past the midpoint from the domain of irregularity to that of regularity. Although we recognize the limitations of comparing across metrics, we observe that metrics that can describe the full irregularity–regularity range tend to regularity in the adult brain (e.g., avalanche <span class="citation" data-cites="xuAvalancheCriticalityIndividuals2022">(<a href="#ref-xuAvalancheCriticalityIndividuals2022" role="doc-biblioref">Xu, Feng, and Yu 2022</a>)</span>; Hurst <span class="citation" data-cites="campbellFractalBasedAnalysisFMRI2022">(<a href="#ref-campbellFractalBasedAnalysisFMRI2022" role="doc-biblioref">Campbell, Vanderwal, and Weber 2022</a>)</span>; both described later in this review). Therefore, the distinction between complexity and irregularity may be only semantic, at least in the healthy adult brain (but perhaps not in other populations – e.g., infants <span class="citation" data-cites="mellaTemporalComplexityBOLDsignal2024">(<a href="#ref-mellaTemporalComplexityBOLDsignal2024" role="doc-biblioref">Mella et al. 2024</a>)</span>). Such distinctions could account for the observed inconsistencies across clinical studies, especially across neuroimaging modalities (see Discussion). In the next section, we will discuss a method to address this limitation: multiscale sample entropy (MSE).</p>

<p>Is a single-scale, like the entropy metrics discussed above, sufficient to describe the brain? The brain is complex across a range of temporal scales, from very short time windows to very long ones, and understanding how these layers interact is essential to understanding the system as a whole <span class="citation" data-cites="beggsCortexCriticalPoint2022 buzsakiRhythmsBrain2006 betzelMultiscaleBrainNetworks2017">(<a href="#ref-beggsCortexCriticalPoint2022" role="doc-biblioref">Beggs 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-buzsakiRhythmsBrain2006" role="doc-biblioref">Buzsáki 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-betzelMultiscaleBrainNetworks2017" role="doc-biblioref">Betzel and Bassett 2017</a>)</span>. For example, in cross-frequency coupling, high-frequency oscillations (i.e., patterns that recur at fine scales) interact with slow ones, allowing for information transmission <span class="citation" data-cites="canoltyFunctionalRoleCrossfrequency2010">(<a href="#ref-canoltyFunctionalRoleCrossfrequency2010" role="doc-biblioref">Canolty and Knight 2010</a>)</span>. More broadly, fractality — or being similar across multiple scales (discussed below) — appears to be essential to brain function <span class="citation" data-cites="wernerFractalsNervousSystem2010">(<a href="#ref-wernerFractalsNervousSystem2010" role="doc-biblioref">Werner 2010</a>)</span>. A better complexity metric would therefore have the ability to describe patterns that occur across multiple scales.</p>
<p>MSE was developed to more fully characterize the complexity of physiological signals by describing SE over multiple scales <span class="citation" data-cites="costaMultiscaleEntropyAnalysis2003 yangComplexitySpontaneousBOLD2013">(<a href="#ref-costaMultiscaleEntropyAnalysis2003" role="doc-biblioref">Costa and Healey 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-yangComplexitySpontaneousBOLD2013" role="doc-biblioref">A. C. Yang et al. 2013</a>)</span>. This is achieved by downsampling the original time series to multiple lower temporal resolutions to create “new” series across a range of lower frequencies (<a href="#fig-downsampling" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12</a>). The SE algorithm is then applied to each series, resulting in a unique SE value for each temporal resolution. That is, the final output consists of a vector of SE values, one for each resolution. Because the output is not a single number, it can be hard to interpret. Typically, results are presented as a plot of SE versus sampling resolution (<a href="#fig-msescale" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>). As an attempt to summarize the output, the slope of this plot or the mean value across scales may also be reported.</p>

<p>Unlike single-scale entropy, MSE can differentiate randomness from complexity. The shape of the scale-MSE curve is neurophysiologically meaningful (<a href="#fig-msescale" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>). MSE for white noise is high at short scales (where there are random fluctuations) and decreases at coarser scales, as fluctuations are smoothed out [<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014">McDonough and Nashiro (<a href="#ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>; hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017] (however, this may be due to bias; see <span class="citation" data-cites="kosciessaStandardMultiscaleEntropy2020">Kosciessa, Kloosterman, and Garrett (<a href="#ref-kosciessaStandardMultiscaleEntropy2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). Fully preprocessed cerebrospinal fluid signal, which in theory consists of a series of uncorrelated random observations and therefore approximates white noise, has a high-then-low MSE curve <span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014">(<a href="#ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" role="doc-biblioref">McDonough and Nashiro 2014</a>)</span>. On the other hand, complex signals, which contain meaningful information across scales, have approximately horizontal MSE curves. For instance, pink and brown noise — which, unlike white noise, contain autocorrelation (i.e., future values are influenced by past ones) — both have characteristic MSE curves (<a href="#fig-msescale" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>), with pink noise, which contains more autocorrelation than brown, having the flatter curve [<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014">McDonough and Nashiro (<a href="#ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="omidvarniaTemporalComplexityFMRI2021">Omidvarnia, Zalesky, et al. (<a href="#ref-omidvarniaTemporalComplexityFMRI2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>; hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017; smithMultipleTimeScale2014]. Consistent with the idea that BOLD signal from grey matter contains the more meaningful information, its MSE more closely resembles that of pink noise than that of white noise [<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014">McDonough and Nashiro (<a href="#ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="omidvarniaTemporalComplexityFMRI2021">Omidvarnia, Zalesky, et al.

Sokunbi 2014</a>)</span>. Furthermore, for MSE to be most useful, the series must be long enough to support multiple resolutions of downsampling. Fortunately for fMRI researchers, <span class="citation" data-cites="grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016">Grandy et al. (<a href="#ref-grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> showed that MSE can be effectively estimated across discontinuous segments (i.e., multiple runs of fMRI can be concatenated and the estimation will still be effective).</p>

<section id="permutation-entropy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="permutation-entropy">Permutation entropy</h4>
<p>Permutation entropy (PE) considers only the order of amplitude values, not absolute amplitudes <span class="citation" data-cites="bandtPermutationEntropyNatural2002">(<a href="#ref-bandtPermutationEntropyNatural2002" role="doc-biblioref">Bandt and Pompe 2002</a>)</span>. PE calculation uses a sliding window to slice the series into overlapping segments called “embedded vectors.” Each embedded vector is matched to a motif (called a “permutation pattern” or an “ordinal pattern”), which represents the relative order of the values in the vector. PE is the Shannon entropy of the relative frequencies of the ordinal patterns. That is, PE is closely related to Shannon entropy, but considers the order of values. Compared to ApEn and SE, PE is simpler to compute, makes fewer assumptions, and is more robust in the presence of noise <span class="citation" data-cites="zaninPermutationEntropyIts2012">(<a href="#ref-zaninPermutationEntropyIts2012" role="doc-biblioref">Zanin et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are several variants of PE. PE can be computed on downsampled versions of the data (i.e., multiscale permutation entropy), resulting in a description of PE across frequencies <span class="citation" data-cites="wohlschlagerSpectralDynamicsResting2018">(<a href="#ref-wohlschlagerSpectralDynamicsResting2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wohlschläger et al. 2018</a>)</span>. Weighted permutation entropy (wPE) was introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="fadlallahWeightedpermutationEntropyComplexity2013">Fadlallah et al. (<a href="#ref-fadlallahWeightedpermutationEntropyComplexity2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, and incorporates amplitude information into the PE calculation by multiplying each embedded vector by a weight. Unlike PE, wPE is affected by spikes and abrupt amplitude changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="fuzzy-entropy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fuzzy-entropy">Fuzzy entropy</h4>
<p>Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) is identical to SE but defines similarity differently <span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonoughEvidenceMaintainedPostEncoding2019">(<a href="#ref-mcdonoughEvidenceMaintainedPostEncoding2019" role="doc-biblioref">McDonough et al. 2019</a>)</span>. SE defines similarity using the Heaviside function; unfortunately, this function has a rigid boundary, leading to limitations including information loss and parameter-dependence. In contrast, FuzzyEn defines similarity using a fuzzy function and is thus an improved measure of complexity.</p>
</section>
<section id="permutation-fuzzy-entropy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="permutation-fuzzy-entropy">Permutation fuzzy entropy</h4>

(<a href="#ref-niuComparingTestRetestReliability2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. It is calculated by first performing permutations on the original time series — which reduces the impact of noise — then computing FuzzyEn.

<section id="range-entropy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="range-entropy">Range entropy</h4>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dispersion-entropy">Dispersion entropy</h4>

Table&nbsp;3: <strong>fMRI-Hurst studies.</strong> An attempt to gather all published fMRI studies that have used Hurst or Hurst-like analysis, some stats, and the main findings. Main findings are almost certainly more nuanced than how we have reported them here; we have attempted to condense the findings as succinctly as possible. n = number of subjects in the study; TR = repition time; MLWD = maximum likelihood wavelet; PSD<sub>Welch</sub> = power spectral density Welch method; DMN = default mode network; DFA = detrended fluctuation analysis; DA = dispersional analysis; SWV = scaled window variance; RS = rescaled range; LW = local Whittle;

  abstract = {For decades, fMRI analysis has predominantly focused on
    linear relationships, such as simple signal magnitude changes and
    pair-wise functional connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that
    failing to account for the brain’s non-linear, dynamic organization
    may lead to incomplete inferences about neural processes. More
    recently, cognitive and clinical neuroimaging have begun to draw on
    tools from complexity science to characterize the nonlinear dynamics
    of the brain. Temporal complexity metrics reflect a range of
    approaches to complexity in time series, including describing the
    system’s regularity and irregularity, predictability and
    unpredictability, information compressibility, long-term memory, and
    fractal patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
    applications of temporal complexity are scattered across siloed
    literatures with varying clarity, which limits accessibility and
    therefore popularity. This review aims to bridge this gap by
    communicating the basics of temporal complexity to fMRI scientists.
    We offer a comprehensive guide to temporal complexity in fMRI,
    including an overview of fMRI temporal complexity metrics—Shannon
    entropy, variations of (multi-scale) sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv
    complexity, avalanche measures, and Hurst—followed by a
    comprehensive review of extant applications in fMRI.}
