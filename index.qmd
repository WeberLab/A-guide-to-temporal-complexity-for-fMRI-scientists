  For decades, fMRI analysis has predominantly focused on linear relationships, such as simple signal magnitude changes and pair-wise functional connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that failing to account for the brain's non-linear, dynamic organization may lead to incomplete inferences about neural processes. More recently,  cognitive and clinical neuroimaging have begun to draw on tools from complexity science to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. Temporal complexity metrics reflect a range of approaches to complexity in time series, including describing the system's regularity and irregularity, predictability and unpredictability, information compressibility, long-term memory, and fractal patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), applications of temporal complexity are scattered across siloed literatures with varying clarity, which limits accessibility and therefore popularity. This review aims to bridge this gap by communicating the basics of temporal complexity to fMRI scientists. We offer a comprehensive guide to temporal complexity in fMRI, including an overview of fMRI temporal complexity metrics—Shannon entropy, variations of (multi-scale) sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, avalanche measures, and Hurst—followed by a comprehensive review of extant applications in fMRI.

## Introduction

The brain is a complex system that exhibits nonlinear dynamics across multiple dimensions, including in how its activity unfolds over time. Capturing these dynamics requires more than traditional static summaries of average activity or connectivity. Instead, approaches are needed that explicitly quantify the temporal richness of brain function. One informal grouping of such approaches is temporal complexity (@fig-wordcloud). Temporal complexity metrics reflect diverse assumptions and motivations, but broadly aim to quantify regularity and irregularity in time series, including features like recurring patterns, memory, and unpredictability [@varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020]. Temporal complexity is the most common of the complex-systems approaches to the brain (e.g., see @sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020 for a domain-specific review (Alzheimer's)), and is present across scales (@fig-scales), from the cellular to large-scale functional networks [@cofreEntropyComplexityTools2025].

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indirectly assess temporal complexity in brain activity through the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Despite the fact that fMRI is traditionally considered unsuitable for rigorous temporal analyses --- its time series are sampled slowly (0.5--3 s), and are relatively short in length (5--10 minutes), limiting access to fine-scale dynamics and data-hungry metrics [@grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016] --- a growing literature shows that coarse-scale dynamics remain informative. These dynamics have been linked to both cognitive and clinical states and have be reliably characterized using fMRI recordings [@sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016; @xinApplicationComplexityAnalysis2021].

Compared to other neuroimaging modalities (reviewed in [@sarassoConsciousnessComplexityConsilience2021; @sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020; @hernandezBrainComplexityPsychiatric2023; @keshmiriEntropyBrainOverview2020; @yangMentalIllnessComplex2013]), however, temporal complexity metrics are seldom used in fMRI research. This is reflected in a diffuse, unstandardized landscape in which methods are siloed across research groups, limiting accessibility and comparability. The present review aims to help bridge this gap. Going beyond previous reviews of complexity in fMRI [@sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016; xinApplicationComplexityAnalysis2021], we have attempted to systematically identify all temporal complexity metrics used in fMRI research and all relevant papers that used each metric. To our knowledge, no prior review has undertaken this task at this scope.

This review also differs from previous reviews in its primary aim. Rather than summarize prior clinical and neuroscience findings (although we do include this as well), we have focused on providing guidance for clinical and cognitive researchers who wish to implement temporal complexity metrics. Many such researchers lack a background in information theory and thus face a choice: either apply temporal complexity measures without fully understanding the theoretical context --- risking methodological or interpretational errors --- or invest considerable time learning about a vast, interdisciplinary, and technically varied literature. Our review aims to solve this problem by serving as both a comprehensive and accessible resource for temporal complexity methods in fMRI.

<!-- TODO: Describe the sections you are about to review --> 

What follows is first a review of the basic concepts of various temporal complexity metrics and the history of their applications to fMRI, followed by a comparison of these metrics, and finally a discussion that explores their clinical and neuroscience findings. 
## What is complexity?

Complexity is conceptualized as involving a balance between order and disorder [@spornsNetworksBrain2010]. Uniform systems (e.g., crystal lattices; sine waves) are not complex, nor are completely irregular ones (e.g., randomly moving particles; white noise); rather, complexity lies between these two extremes, combining predictability and unpredictability [@varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020].

<!-- TODO: fill this out more --> 

## Variability

In order to get a sense of temporal complexity, it may help to first describe how it differs from variability. Complexity and variability are statistically distinct, yet closely intertwined. Temporal complexity and variability both describe the temporal dynamics of neurophysiological signal, with variability describing signal spread, and complexity describing within-series interactions and recurring patterns (@fig-variability). A time series that is more complex is not necessarily more variable, and vice versa. Indeed, some measures of complexity explicitly make use of variability as a measure across different scales (e.g., Approximate entropy [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000] or Rescaled range to measure the Hurst exponent [@hurstLongTermStorageCapacity1951]). Nevertheless, complexity and variability are closely related. Across theoretical perspectives, changes in a system (i.e. it's variance) are fundamentally related to the complexity of its behaviour [@lotfiStatisticalComplexityMaximized2021; @garrettMomenttomomentBrainSignal2013; @chialvoLifeEdgeComplexity2018; @heScaleFreePropertiesFunctional2011]. Intuitively, a system cannot exhibit complex behaviour if its variability is either minimal or maximal --- that is, if it is in complete stasis or fluctuates completely randomly. 

![Conceptual comparison of the features captured by the mean (a measure of central tendency), variance (a measure of variability), and Hurst exponent (a measure of complexity; specifically long-term memory). Synthetic waveform from @liMorphologicalCoveringBased2012; figure inspired by @garrettBloodOxygenLevelDependent2010.](./images/300_dpi/Fig3.png){#fig-variability width=450}

<!-- There is a growing literature on signal variability. Briefly: Variability is essential to brain function (Garrett et al., 2013; Baracchini et al., 2023). Measures of temporal signal variability are relevant to cognition, lifespan development, and disease (Steinberg & King, 2024; Goodman et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023). These measures include variance (He, 2011), standard deviation (SD; the square root of the variance; Garrett et al., 2010), and mean square successive differences (similar to variance, but comparisons are made between adjacent timepoints in the series; Leo et al., 2012; Afyouni & Nichols, 2018). -->

 <!-- From a complex-systems perspective, complexity relies on a particular degree of variability, with both minimal variability (i.e., complete order) and maximal variability (i.e., complete randomness) being associated with low complexity (e.g., Lofti et al., 2021; Garrett et al., 2013; Chialvo, 2018; He, 2011; Steinberg & King, 2024; Goodman et al., 2024). Note that the terms complexity and variability are nonetheless sometimes used interchangeably (e.g., Jaworska et al., 2018).--> 

A review of empirical comparisons between variability and complexity in fMRI is provided in the later section "Comparisons of All Metrics."

## Entropy measures

Entropy, in the context of time-series and brain signals, is a measure of uncertainty, irregularity, or unpredictability in a signal. It originates from information theory and statistical mechanics, but has been adapted into many specialized forms for analyzing neural dynamics. It is by far the most popular and diverse measure we encountered in our literature search, and is thus where we begin our review.

### Shannon entropy

Shannon entropy serves as the foundation for virtually all contemporary entropy measures, and its introduction marked the birth of information theory [@shannonCommunicationPresenceNoise1949]. Shannon entropy quantifies uncertainty; it can be thought of as the difficulty of predicting an observation's value (@fig-entropyuncertainty). Applied to a time series, it measures the minimum number of 'bits' needed to encode the series based on the frequency of values (@fig-entropybolddistribution).

![Shannon entropy represents uncertainty about an observation's value. Image adapted from @serranoShannonEntropyInformation2018.](./images/300_dpi/Fig4.png){#fig-entropyuncertainty width=450}

![Shannon entropy reflects the distribution of values; a wider distribution of BOLD signal values (blue) has higher entropy, while a narrower distribution of values (green) has lower entropy](./images/300_dpi/Fig5.png){#fig-entropybolddistribution width=450}

Shannon entropy can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\log(p_{i})
$$ {#eq-shannonentropy}

where $H$ is entropy and $p_{i}$ is the frequency of a given value.

<!-- TODO: might need to distinguish frequency from probability and wavelengths --> 

Shannon entropy is seldom used to assess the temporal complexity of neuroimaging time series. Instead, it is most commonly applied to spatiotemporal properties—for example, to quantify the complexity of functional connectivity (FC) [@violShannonEntropyBrain2017; @pappasBrainNetworkDisintegration2019]. This is because the classic formulation only considers frequency values, not their order. The resulting metric is poorly suited to describe how a series changes over time. Only one study, by @huangDefaultModeNetwork2025, used Shannon entropy of frequency of values (details in discussion). However, several studies have applied Shannon entropy to wavelet-decomposed time series (i.e., analyzing the entropy of different frequency bins; method described in @rossoWaveletEntropyNew2001), which has been shown to be an improvement over the classic formulation. For example, @guptaWaveletEntropyBOLD2017 found that Shannon wavelet entropy was able to discriminate epilepsy patients from controls, whereas classical Shannon entropy was not.

Although Shannon entropy is rarely applied with the explicit aim of describing temporal complexity, it has been used as an innovative alternative to traditional methods of analyzing event-related fMRI data. Unlike traditional methods, entropy makes no assumptions about the shape of the evoked hemodynamic response, which can improve stability and sensitivity [@mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012; @ostwaldInformationTheoreticApproaches2011]. @dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003 were the first to apply Shannon entropy to event-related fMRI analysis. They calculated entropy within time windows during activation and rest; the rise and fall of the entropy measure mirrored the theoretical hemodynamic response (@fig-shannonentropyevents). Compared to traditional cross-correlation, Shannon entropy was more stable with a changing signal-to-noise ratio [@dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003]. @dinuzzoTemporalInformationEntropy2017 also used Shannon entropy in event-related analysis, which allowed them to capture changes induced by photic stimulation that were missed by traditional temporal descriptors (e.g., variance). Together, these results indicate that Shannon entropy may capture features of BOLD dynamics that escape conventional temporal measures. More broadly, this demonstrates the usefulness of temporal dynamics in situations where spatial maps are unable to fully capture condition differences.

![An example of how Shannon entropy can be used to analyze event-related data (de Araujo et al., 2003). Image stylized/recreated from de Araujo et al. (2003).](./images/300_dpi/Fig6.png){#fig-shannonentropyevents width=450}

<!-- TODO: I wonder if the following paragraph we can get rid of? --> 

Several extensions to Shannon entropy have been introduced as alternatives to conventional methods for discriminating task conditions in event-related fMRI. A comprehensive list of these methods and their applications is as follows: Tsallis entropy (applied by [@sturzbecherNonextensiveEntropyExtraction2009; @wangInvestigatingUnivariateTemporal2013], Renyi entropy [@gonzalezandinoMeasuringComplexityTime2000; @wangInvestigatingUnivariateTemporal2013], generalized relative entropy [@cabellaGeneralizedRelativeEntropy2009; @welvaertHowIgnoringPhysiological2012], adaptive entropy rate [@fisherAdaptiveEntropyRates2001], and time-lagged mutual information [@tsaiAnalysisFunctionalMRI1999; @fuhrmannalpertSpatiotemporalInformationAnalysis2007; @alpertTemporalCharacteristicsAudiovisual2008; @tedeschiGeneralizedMutualInformation2004; @tedeschiGeneralizedMutualInformation2005; @vonwegnerMutualInformationIdentifies2018]. Despite their potential effectiveness in event-related fMRI analysis, these methods have not been widely adopted, neither since they were first reviewed by @mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012, nor in the decade since. This may be because of their high computational demands or simply because there are better approaches to model-free hemodynamic response estimation (e.g., finite-impulse-response models [@metzakConstrainedPrincipalComponent2011]. No studies have systematically evaluated whether Shannon-entropy-based analysis methods discriminate task conditions better than conventional ones, which leaves a knowledge gap.

### Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy

In contrast to Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy takes time into account (@fig-ksentropy), allowing for application to dynamical systems [@nogueiraExploringLinkMultiscale2017]. As a system evolves, KS entropy quantifies the average rate at which information is produced with each new state; that is, it quantifies the difficulty of predicting future observations given past observations. Higher KS entropy implies that a higher amount of information is being introduced at each time point, meaning that the series is more unpredictable. Like Shannon entropy, KS entropy implements the intuitive notion that a broader distribution of data values should correspond to greater uncertainty. 

![Because Shannon entropy only depends on the distribution of values and not their order, two sequences may look different but have the same Shannon entropy. Here, both series have the same Shannon entropy, but the series on the right has higher KS entropy. Original image](./images/300_dpi/Fig7.png){#fig-ksentropy width=450}

KS entropy is difficult to apply to real-world data, given that proper implementation requires exceedingly large amounts of time series data and an absence of noise [@pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991; @richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. As such, a variety of measures have been developed as approximations for KS entropy. The following sections discuss approximations of KS entropy that have been applied to fMRI research.

### Approximate entropy

In fMRI, nearly all approximations of KS entropy can trace their historical lineage to approximate entropy (ApEn) [@pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991]. First used on cardiovascular time series and later adapted for neuroimaging [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000; @bruhnApproximateEntropyElectroencephalographic2000], ApEn quantifies the probability that sequences of similar patterns in a time series will remain similar when sequence length is increased. A higher value of ApEn signifies that the signal contains fewer repeating patterns—that is, greater complexity.

<!-- TODO: why see Sample Entropy? --> 

In the calculation of ApEn, each sequence is counted as matching itself [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. This nuance leads to two limitations. First, it causes ApEn to be lower than expected for shorter time series [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. This is because counting self-matches inflates the estimation of regularity, and this over-inflation is more prominent for short series. Shortening datasets (e.g., by using one fMRI run instead of two) may change ApEn despite identical patterns. Second, ApEn lacks relative consistency, meaning that comparisons between datasets can be affected by the choice of time-window and tolerance parameters (i.e., if ApEn is higher for one dataset than another using one set of parameters, we would expect this to remain true for other choices of parameters, but this is not the case; [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]). 

Given these limitations, ApEn is rarely used to characterize temporal complexity in fMRI. In most fMRI studies, ApEn is reported only alongside other entropy-based measures --- such as sample entropy (SE) or fuzzy approximate entropy --- and therefore these applications are included in our "Comparisons of All Metrics" section. Two ApEn studies that do not appear in that section are @sokunbiInterindividualDifferencesFMRI2011 and @liuComplexitySynchronicityResting2013; both report clinical findings that align with the broader complexity literature, and we summarize these in the Discussion.

### Sample entropy

Sample entropy (SE) was developed to correct ApEn's limitations [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. The difference between the calculation of SE and that of ApEn is that SE doesn't count self-matches in the conditional probability, which corrects the two limitations described in the ApEn section [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000] (for an example in fMRI, see [@yangStrategyReduceBias2018]. In addition to these advantages, SE is a better approximation of KS entropy and is simpler to compute [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. Accordingly, SE is more widely used than ApEn in fMRI and can be computed using the toolboxes `BENtbx` [https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx; e.g., Wang et al., 2014](https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx) (e.g., @wangBrainEntropyMapping2014) or `Complexity Toolbox` [http://loft-lab.org/index-5.html; e.g., Zhang et al., 2021](http://loft-lab.org/index-5.html) (e.g., @zhangAlteredComplexitySpontaneous2021). SE is most often called "brain entropy" (BEN) [@wangBrainEntropyMapping2014]; however, because BEN can also refer to Shannon entropy [@akdenizComplexityAnalysisRestingState2017], we elected to use the term SE in this review.

To calculate SE, the user specifies two parameters: the time window $m$ and the tolerance scale $r$. $m$ is the number of values to be analysed at a time, and $r$ is the multiplied by the standard deviation (SD) of the series to obtain the tolerance. SE is equal to the negative average natural logarithm of the conditional probability that two sequences that are similar (i.e., within the tolerance) for $m$ points will stay similar for $m+1$ points [@richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000]. Because conditional probability is between 0 and 1, SE will always be positive. When the time series is highly regular (i.e., when similar runs remain similar), SE is low; when the time series is irregular, SE is high [@pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991]. See @fig-sampleentropyconceptual for a conceptual explanation, @fig-sampleentropycomputational for a computational explanation, and @delgado-bonalApproximateEntropySample2019 for a tutorial. For a detailed guide to selecting $m$ and $r$, see Appendix A1 and Figure A1.

<!-- TODO: add A1 and Fig A1 --> 

What is the minimum number of timepoints needed for SE? In general, more timepoints improve results. For example, using simulated data, @grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016 found that SE accuracy and precision increased fairly linearly from the shortest to longest series tested (32 to 32,768). @wehrheimReliabilityVariabilityComplexity2024 (@fig-SEtimepoints) observed strong (albeit non-significant) correlations between reliability and series length, including a slow increase in split-half correlation from the shortest to longest series tested (100-800), along with a steady increase in test--retest correlation that plateaued around 500. Highlighting that the relationship between length and reliability is dataset--dependent, they found differences in rest versus task data (for a wide variety of tasks, including cognitive, motor, and social). As for the lower limit of length, @yangStrategyReduceBias2018 identified a lower bound of 97 timepoints; for series shorter than 97, SE could still be calculated, but with a narrower range of $m-$ and $r-$values. @sokunbiSampleEntropyReveals2014 found that SE discriminated between young and old adults in series as short as 85 in a small (n = 20) cohort. Again highlighting that length limitations are dataset-dependent, @sokunbiSampleEntropyReveals2014 found that more data points were needed in a larger (n = 86) cohort (potentially because the smaller cohort had low inter-individual variability). 

![SE accuracy (and precision, not shown) increase with increasing series length. Figure stylized based on results from Wehreim et al. (2024).](./images/300_dpi/Fig10.png){#fig-SEtimepoints width=450}

Several innovations to SE have been made in recent years. @delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024 introduced "cross" SE, a method for comparing multiple SE maps which can be applied to make comparisons between subjects, sessions, scan times, or regions. Thus far, cross entropy has been used to show a decoupling between the (across-subject) mean and variance of SE across different brain regions [@delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024]. @wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021 pioneered dynamic SE, wherein SE is estimated for every segment of a sliding window. Despite its name, dynamic SE is not designed to be used to track changes in SE over the course of a run; instead, SE for each segment is combined into a final run mean. In a sample of 862 subjects, @wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021 found minimal differences between static (traditional) and dynamic SE.

The entropy-based metrics discussed thus far --- Shannon entropy, KS entropy, ApEn, and SE --- are maximized with maximum randomness (@fig-entropymonotonic). That is, these metrics are formulated to increase monotonically with series randomness. Contrast this with the definition we described at the beginning, where complexity is a balance of regularity and irregularity, the "ideal" complexity metric should be maximized at an intermediate point these two extremes. Therefore, strictly speaking, despite being the most commonly used metrics, ApEn and SE do not truly capture "complexity."

![A) Entropy measures (Shannon entropy, SE, ApEn, and others; but not MSE) increase monotonically with data randomness. B) In contrast, an ideal complexity measure would represent the balance between order and disorder. Image adapted from @yangMentalIllnessComplex2013](./images/300_dpi/Fig12.png){#fig-entropymonotonic}

How much of a limitation is this? We are reluctant to dismiss the breadth of good work that has already been completed; in our view, the conflation of complexity and irregularity is only a limitation if, at the scale under investigation, the comparison involves shifts past the midpoint from the domain of irregularity to that of regularity. Although we recognize the limitations of comparing across metrics, we observe that metrics that can describe the full irregularity--regularity range tend to regularity in the adult brain (e.g., avalanche [@xuAvalancheCriticalityIndividuals2022]; Hurst [@campbellFractalBasedAnalysisFMRI2022]; both described later in this review). Therefore, the distinction between complexity and irregularity may be only semantic, at least in the healthy adult brain (but perhaps not in other populations -- e.g., infants [@mellaTemporalComplexityBOLDsignal2024]). Such distinctions could account for the observed inconsistencies across clinical studies, especially across neuroimaging modalities (see Discussion). In the next section, we will discuss a method to address this limitation: multiscale sample entropy (MSE). 

### Multiscale sample entropy

Is a single-scale, like the entropy metrics discussed above, sufficient to describe the brain? The brain is complex across a range of temporal scales, from very short time windows to very long ones, and understanding how these layers interact is essential to understanding the system as a whole [@beggsCortexCriticalPoint2022; @buzsakiRhythmsBrain2006; @betzelMultiscaleBrainNetworks2017]. For example, in cross-frequency coupling, high-frequency oscillations (i.e., patterns that recur at fine scales) interact with slow ones, allowing for information transmission [@canoltyFunctionalRoleCrossfrequency2010]. More broadly, fractality --- or being similar across multiple scales (discussed below) --- appears to be essential to brain function [@wernerFractalsNervousSystem2010]. A better complexity metric would therefore have the ability to describe patterns that occur across multiple scales.

MSE was developed to more fully characterize the complexity of physiological signals by describing SE over multiple scales [@costaMultiscaleEntropyAnalysis2003; @yangComplexitySpontaneousBOLD2013]. This is achieved by downsampling the original time series to multiple lower temporal resolutions to create "new" series across a range of lower frequencies (@fig-downsampling). The SE algorithm is then applied to each series, resulting in a unique SE value for each temporal resolution. That is, the final output consists of a vector of SE values, one for each resolution. Because the output is not a single number, it can be hard to interpret. Typically, results are presented as a plot of SE versus sampling resolution (@fig-msescale). As an attempt to summarize the output, the slope of this plot or the mean value across scales may also be reported. 

![An illustration of downsampling of a time series. Image recreated from @kadotaMultiscaleEntropyRestingState2021.](./images/300_dpi/Fig13.png){#fig-downsampling width=450}

![MSE profiles for simulated white, pink, and red noise; preprocessed CSF; and grey matter (resting-state networks). Figure stylized based on results from McDonough et al. (2014). Note that scale is not the same as frequency, as scale and frequency are terms from entirely different frameworks; however, were these concepts to be compared, fine scales (low $m$ values) would roughly map to high frequencies (fast-moving oscillations) and coarse scales (high $m$) to low frequencies (slow drifts). CSF = cerebrospinal fluid](./images/300_dpi/Fig14.png){#fig-msescale}

Unlike single-scale entropy, MSE can differentiate randomness from complexity. The shape of the scale-MSE curve is neurophysiologically meaningful (@fig-msescale). MSE for white noise is high at short scales (where there are random fluctuations) and decreases at coarser scales, as fluctuations are smoothed out [@mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014; hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017] (however, this may be due to bias; see @kosciessaStandardMultiscaleEntropy2020). Fully preprocessed cerebrospinal fluid signal, which in theory consists of a series of uncorrelated random observations and therefore approximates white noise, has a high-then-low MSE curve [@mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014]. On the other hand, complex signals, which contain meaningful information across scales, have approximately horizontal MSE curves. For instance, pink and brown noise --- which, unlike white noise, contain autocorrelation (i.e., future values are influenced by past ones) --- both have characteristic MSE curves (@fig-msescale), with pink noise, which contains more autocorrelation than brown, having the flatter curve [@mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014; @omidvarniaTemporalComplexityFMRI2021; hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017; smithMultipleTimeScale2014]. Consistent with the idea that BOLD signal from grey matter contains the more meaningful information, its MSE more closely resembles that of pink noise than that of white noise [@mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014; @omidvarniaTemporalComplexityFMRI2021; hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017; smithMultipleTimeScale2014]. See Appendix A2 for an in-depth discussion of the significance of the MSE curve in grey matter, and for a discussion of the major limitations of MSE. See Appendix A3 for detailed instructions on choosing parameters for MSE calculation, including $m$ and $r$. 

<!-- TODO: A2 and A3 --> 

What are the limitations of MSE? MSE requires a long time series for proper computation and utilization. Series must be long enough such that the longest scale (e.g., lowest temporal resolution) produced through downsampling contains at least 80 timepoints [@sokunbiSampleEntropyReveals2014]. Furthermore, for MSE to be most useful, the series must be long enough to support multiple resolutions of downsampling. Fortunately for fMRI researchers, @grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016 showed that MSE can be effectively estimated across discontinuous segments (i.e., multiple runs of fMRI can be concatenated and the estimation will still be effective). 

See @tbl-fmriSE for a complete summary of fMRI-MSE studies and their findings.

### Other entropy-related measures

Beyond Shannon entropy, ApEn, SE, and MSE, a range of other entropy metrics are available (@fig-otherentropymeasures). These metrics are commonly used in other neuroimaging modalities (see @keshmiriEntropyBrainOverview2020), but are seldom employed in fMRI. @tbl-otherentropy summarizes fMRI studies using these metrics. 

![**Historical development of several entropy-related measures used in fMRI time series.** Time proceeds down arrowheads. This is not comprehensive; for instance, RangeEn can be computed using the algorithm for ApEn as well as SE, but only SE is displayed for simplicity. Temporal complexity measures are much more extensively used in EEG/MEG than in fMRI; accordingly, the entropy measures identified in our search represent a small subspace of what is possible. Also, note that nearly all these measures have multiscale versions --- e.g., MSE, multiscale permutation entropy, and multiscale fuzzy entropy --- are not displayed](./images/300_dpi/Fig15.png){#fig-otherentropymeasures width=450}

Studies that use several metrics are not in this table; instead, they are in @tbl-comparisons. HC means healthy controls. {#tbl-otherentropy}

#### Permutation entropy

Permutation entropy (PE) considers only the order of amplitude values, not absolute amplitudes [@bandtPermutationEntropyNatural2002]. PE calculation uses a sliding window to slice the series into overlapping segments called "embedded vectors." Each embedded vector is matched to a motif (called a "permutation pattern" or an "ordinal pattern"), which represents the relative order of the values in the vector. PE is the Shannon entropy of the relative frequencies of the ordinal patterns. That is, PE is closely related to Shannon entropy, but considers the order of values. Compared to ApEn and SE, PE is simpler to compute, makes fewer assumptions, and is more robust in the presence of noise [@zaninPermutationEntropyIts2012]. 

There are several variants of PE. PE can be computed on downsampled versions of the data (i.e., multiscale permutation entropy), resulting in a description of PE across frequencies [@wohlschlagerSpectralDynamicsResting2018]. Weighted permutation entropy (wPE) was introduced by @fadlallahWeightedpermutationEntropyComplexity2013, and incorporates amplitude information into the PE calculation by multiplying each embedded vector by a weight. Unlike PE, wPE is affected by spikes and abrupt amplitude changes. 

#### Fuzzy entropy
Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) is identical to SE but defines similarity differently [@mcdonoughEvidenceMaintainedPostEncoding2019]. SE defines similarity using the Heaviside function; unfortunately, this function has a rigid boundary, leading to limitations including information loss and parameter-dependence. In contrast, FuzzyEn defines similarity using a fuzzy function and is thus an improved measure of complexity. 

#### Permutation fuzzy entropy
Permutation fuzzy approximate entropy (PFE) was introduced by @niuComparingTestRetestReliability2020. It is calculated by first performing permutations on the original time series --- which reduces the impact of noise --- then computing FuzzyEn. Note that, despite its name, PFE is not directly related to PE.

#### Range entropy
Range entropy (RangeEn) was introduced to address a limitation of SE and ApEn that is pertinent in EEG, which is that these metrics are not robust to variations in signal amplitude [@omidvarniaRangeEntropyBridge2018]. Compared to SE and ApEn, RangeEn is also less affected by variations in signal length, which makes it an option for short-length fMRI time series [@omidvarniaRangeEntropyBridge2018; @omidvarniaRestingStateFMRI2023]. There are two versions of RangeEn: RangeEnA is an improvement to ApEn, and RangeEnB is an improvement to SE [@omidvarniaRangeEntropyBridge2018]. 

#### Dispersion entropy
Dispersion entropy (DispEn) originates from SE and PE and corrects a few problems with these respective techniques --- namely, that SE is slow to calculate, and that PE does not thoroughly describe changes in amplitude [@rostaghiDispersionEntropyMeasure2016]. DispEn is faster to compute than both SE and PE and a better descriptor of frequency and amplitude changes than PE [@rostaghiDispersionEntropyMeasure2016]. 

#### Differential entropy
Differential entropy (DiffEn) describes the spread of the probability density function for a random variable [@coverElementsInformationTheory2005]. It has an interesting history; Claude Shannon thought it was the analogue of discrete entropy for continuous variables, but it is not, and thus is not derived from information-theoretic first principles [@coverElementsInformationTheory2005]. Hence, it changes with simple operations to the series like scaling or shifting, and its values are not always meaningful (as they are sometimes negative) [@coverElementsInformationTheory2005]. Despite these major limitations, DiffEn has been used in EEG (e.g., @duanDifferentialEntropyFeature2013); in fMRI, it has been shown to have test-retest reliability comparable to or exceeding those of other temporal complexity metrics [@wangInvestigatingUnivariateTemporal2013; guanComplexitySpontaneousBrain2023], though no other fMRI studies have used it.

**Main properties of a fractal time-series** A-C show a raw time-series (fractional Gaussian noise in this example) at different scales: B is the first half of A (shown as vertical dashed lines in A), while C is half of B (shown in vertical dashed lines in B). D is a power spectral density plot of A. E shows D but on a log-log plot, demonstrating the linear nature of fractal signals when plotted on a log-log scale. The slope of E is $-\beta$. In this example, $\beta$ is calculated to be 0.6, which translates to an H of 0.8. F shows a modified version of E, which imagines that E only demonstrates a power law scaling relationship between two distinct frequencies. The equation for calculating the scaling range in decades is shown. Exact fractal time-series (A) was created using the Davies-Harte method.

: **fMRI-Hurst studies.** An attempt to gather all published fMRI studies that have used Hurst or Hurst-like analysis, some stats, and the main findings. Main findings are almost certainly more nuanced than how we have reported them here; we have attempted to condense the findings as succinctly as possible. n = number of subjects in the study; TR = repition time; MLWD = maximum likelihood wavelet; PSD~Welch~ = power spectral density Welch method; DMN = default mode network; DFA = detrended fluctuation analysis; DA = dispersional analysis; SWV = scaled window variance; RS = rescaled range; LW = local Whittle;   {#tbl-fmrihurst}
