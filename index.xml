      <abstract>
        <p>For decades, fMRI analysis has predominantly focused on linear
relationships, such as simple signal magnitude changes and pair-wise
functional connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that failing to
account for the brain’s non-linear, dynamic organization may lead to
incomplete inferences about neural processes. More recently, cognitive
and clinical neuroimaging have begun to draw on tools from complexity
science to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. Temporal
complexity metrics reflect a range of approaches to complexity in time
series, including describing the system’s regularity and irregularity,
predictability and unpredictability, information compressibility,
long-term memory, and fractal patterns. In functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), applications of temporal complexity are scattered across
siloed literatures with varying clarity, which limits accessibility and
therefore popularity. This review aims to bridge this gap by
communicating the basics of temporal complexity to fMRI scientists. We
offer a comprehensive guide to temporal complexity in fMRI, including an
overview of fMRI temporal complexity metrics—Shannon entropy, variations
of (multi-scale) sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, avalanche
measures, and Hurst—followed by a comprehensive review of extant
applications in fMRI.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The brain is a complex system that exhibits nonlinear dynamics
  across multiple dimensions, including in how its activity unfolds over
  time. Capturing these dynamics requires more than traditional static
  summaries of average activity or connectivity. Instead, approaches are
  needed that explicitly quantify the temporal richness of brain
  function. One informal grouping of such approaches is temporal
  complexity (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-wordcloud">Figure 1</xref>).
  Temporal complexity metrics reflect diverse assumptions and
  motivations, but broadly aim to quantify regularity and irregularity
  in time series, including features like recurring patterns, memory,
  and unpredictability
  (<xref alt="Varley, Luppi, et al. 2020" rid="ref-varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020" ref-type="bibr">Varley,
  Luppi, et al. 2020</xref>). Temporal complexity is the most common of
  the complex-systems approaches to the brain (e.g., see Sun et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-sunComplexityAnalysisEEG2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
  for a domain-specific review (Alzheimer’s)), and is present across
  scales (<xref alt="Figure 2" rid="fig-scales">Figure 2</xref>), from
  the cellular to large-scale functional networks

      <p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indirectly assess
  temporal complexity in brain activity through the blood-oxygen level
  dependent (BOLD) signal. Despite the fact that fMRI is traditionally
  considered unsuitable for rigorous temporal analyses — its time series
  are sampled slowly (0.5–3 s), and are relatively short in length (5–10
  minutes), limiting access to fine-scale dynamics and data-hungry
  metrics
  (<xref alt="Grandy et al. 2016" rid="ref-grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016" ref-type="bibr">Grandy
  et al. 2016</xref>) — a growing literature shows that coarse-scale
  dynamics remain informative. These dynamics have been linked to both
  cognitive and clinical states and have be reliably characterized using
  fMRI recordings

  C. Yang and Tsai 2013</xref>)), however, temporal complexity metrics
  are seldom used in fMRI research. This is reflected in a diffuse,
  unstandardized landscape in which methods are siloed across research
  groups, limiting accessibility and comparability. The present review
  aims to help bridge this gap. Going beyond previous reviews of
  complexity in fMRI [Moses O. Sokunbi
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-sokunbiBOLDFMRIComplexity2016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>);
  xinApplicationComplexityAnalysis2021], we have attempted to
  systematically identify all temporal complexity metrics used in fMRI
  research and all relevant papers that used each metric. To our
  knowledge, no prior review has undertaken this task at this scope.</p>
      <p>This review also differs from previous reviews in its primary aim.
  Rather than summarize prior clinical and neuroscience findings
  (although we do include this as well), we have focused on providing
  guidance for clinical and cognitive researchers who wish to implement
  temporal complexity metrics. Many such researchers lack a background
  in information theory and thus face a choice: either apply temporal
  complexity measures without fully understanding the theoretical
  context — risking methodological or interpretational errors — or
  invest considerable time learning about a vast, interdisciplinary, and
  technically varied literature. Our review aims to solve this problem
  by serving as both a comprehensive and accessible resource for
  temporal complexity methods in fMRI.</p>
      <p>What follows is first a review of the basic concepts of various
  temporal complexity metrics and the history of their applications to
  fMRI, followed by a comparison of these metrics, and finally a
  discussion that explores their clinical and neuroscience findings. ##
  What is complexity?</p>
      <p>Complexity is conceptualized as involving a balance between order
  and disorder
  (<xref alt="Sporns 2010" rid="ref-spornsNetworksBrain2010" ref-type="bibr">Sporns
  2010</xref>). Uniform systems (e.g., crystal lattices; sine waves) are
  not complex, nor are completely irregular ones (e.g., randomly moving
  particles; white noise); rather, complexity lies between these two
  extremes, combining predictability and unpredictability
  (<xref alt="Varley, Luppi, et al. 2020" rid="ref-varleyConsciousnessBrainFunctional2020" ref-type="bibr">Varley,
  Luppi, et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="variability">
      <title>Variability</title>
      <p>In order to get a sense of temporal complexity, it may help to
  first describe how it differs from variability. Complexity and
  variability are statistically distinct, yet closely intertwined.
  Temporal complexity and variability both describe the temporal
  dynamics of neurophysiological signal, with variability describing
  signal spread, and complexity describing within-series interactions
  and recurring patterns
  (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-variability">Figure 3</xref>). A time
  series that is more complex is not necessarily more variable, and vice
  versa. Indeed, some measures of complexity explicitly make use of
  variability as a measure across different scales (e.g., Approximate
  entropy
  (<xref alt="Richman and Moorman 2000" rid="ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" ref-type="bibr">Richman
  and Moorman 2000</xref>) or Rescaled range to measure the Hurst
  exponent
  (<xref alt="Hurst 1951" rid="ref-hurstLongTermStorageCapacity1951" ref-type="bibr">Hurst
  1951</xref>)). Nevertheless, complexity and variability are closely
  related. Across theoretical perspectives, changes in a system
  (i.e. it’s variance) are fundamentally related to the complexity of
  its behaviour
  (<xref alt="Lotfi et al. 2021" rid="ref-lotfiStatisticalComplexityMaximized2021" ref-type="bibr">Lotfi
  et al. 2021</xref>;

  <xref alt="He 2011" rid="ref-heScaleFreePropertiesFunctional2011" ref-type="bibr">He
  2011</xref>). Intuitively, a system cannot exhibit complex behaviour
  if its variability is either minimal or maximal — that is, if it is in
  complete stasis or fluctuates completely randomly.</p>

      <title>Entropy measures</title>
      <p>Entropy, in the context of time-series and brain signals, is a
  measure of uncertainty, irregularity, or unpredictability in a signal.
  It originates from information theory and statistical mechanics, but
  has been adapted into many specialized forms for analyzing neural
  dynamics. It is by far the most popular and diverse measure we
  encountered in our literature search, and is thus where we begin our
  review.</p>

        <p>Shannon entropy is seldom used to assess the temporal complexity
    of neuroimaging time series. Instead, it is most commonly applied to
    spatiotemporal properties—for example, to quantify the complexity of
    functional connectivity (FC)
    (<xref alt="Viol et al. 2017" rid="ref-violShannonEntropyBrain2017" ref-type="bibr">Viol

    <xref alt="Pappas et al. 2019" rid="ref-pappasBrainNetworkDisintegration2019" ref-type="bibr">Pappas
    et al. 2019</xref>). This is because the classic formulation only
    considers frequency values, not their order. The resulting metric is
    poorly suited to describe how a series changes over time. Only one
    study, by Huang et al.
    (<xref alt="2025" rid="ref-huangDefaultModeNetwork2025" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>),
    used Shannon entropy of frequency of values (details in discussion).
    However, several studies have applied Shannon entropy to
    wavelet-decomposed time series (i.e., analyzing the entropy of
    different frequency bins; method described in Rosso et al.
    (<xref alt="2001" rid="ref-rossoWaveletEntropyNew2001" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>)),
    which has been shown to be an improvement over the classic
    formulation. For example, Gupta et al.
    (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-guptaWaveletEntropyBOLD2017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
    found that Shannon wavelet entropy was able to discriminate epilepsy
    patients from controls, whereas classical Shannon entropy was
    not.</p>
        <p>Although Shannon entropy is rarely applied with the explicit aim
    of describing temporal complexity, it has been used as an innovative
    alternative to traditional methods of analyzing event-related fMRI
    data. Unlike traditional methods, entropy makes no assumptions about
    the shape of the evoked hemodynamic response, which can improve
    stability and sensitivity
    (<xref alt="Mikoláš et al. 2012" rid="ref-mikolasAnalysisFMRITimeseries2012" ref-type="bibr">Mikoláš

    (<xref alt="2003" rid="ref-dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>)
    were the first to apply Shannon entropy to event-related fMRI
    analysis. They calculated entropy within time windows during
    activation and rest; the rise and fall of the entropy measure
    mirrored the theoretical hemodynamic response
    (<xref alt="Figure 6" rid="fig-shannonentropyevents">Figure 6</xref>).
    Compared to traditional cross-correlation, Shannon entropy was more
    stable with a changing signal-to-noise ratio
    (<xref alt="De Araujo et al. 2003" rid="ref-dearaujoShannonEntropyApplied2003" ref-type="bibr">De
    Araujo et al. 2003</xref>). DiNuzzo et al.
    (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-dinuzzoTemporalInformationEntropy2017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
    also used Shannon entropy in event-related analysis, which allowed
    them to capture changes induced by photic stimulation that were
    missed by traditional temporal descriptors (e.g., variance).
    Together, these results indicate that Shannon entropy may capture
    features of BOLD dynamics that escape conventional temporal
    measures. More broadly, this demonstrates the usefulness of temporal
    dynamics in situations where spatial maps are unable to fully
    capture condition differences.</p>

    rate at which information is produced with each new state; that is,
    it quantifies the difficulty of predicting future observations given
    past observations. Higher KS entropy implies that a higher amount of
    information is being introduced at each time point, meaning that the
    series is more unpredictable. Like Shannon entropy, KS entropy
    implements the intuitive notion that a broader distribution of data

        <p>In fMRI, nearly all approximations of KS entropy can trace their
    historical lineage to approximate entropy (ApEn)
    (<xref alt="Pincus 1991" rid="ref-pincusApproximateEntropyMeasure1991" ref-type="bibr">Pincus

    Röpcke, and Hoeft 2000</xref>), ApEn quantifies the probability that
    sequences of similar patterns in a time series will remain similar
    when sequence length is increased. A higher value of ApEn signifies
    that the signal contains fewer repeating patterns—that is, greater
    complexity.</p>
        <p>In the calculation of ApEn, each sequence is counted as matching
    itself
    (<xref alt="Richman and Moorman 2000" rid="ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" ref-type="bibr">Richman
    and Moorman 2000</xref>). This nuance leads to two limitations.
    First, it causes ApEn to be lower than expected for shorter time
    series
    (<xref alt="Richman and Moorman 2000" rid="ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" ref-type="bibr">Richman
    and Moorman 2000</xref>). This is because counting self-matches
    inflates the estimation of regularity, and this over-inflation is
    more prominent for short series. Shortening datasets (e.g., by using
    one fMRI run instead of two) may change ApEn despite identical
    patterns. Second, ApEn lacks relative consistency, meaning that
    comparisons between datasets can be affected by the choice of
    time-window and tolerance parameters (i.e., if ApEn is higher for
    one dataset than another using one set of parameters, we would
    expect this to remain true for other choices of parameters, but this
    is not the case;
    (<xref alt="Richman and Moorman 2000" rid="ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" ref-type="bibr">Richman
    and Moorman 2000</xref>)).</p>
        <p>Given these limitations, ApEn is rarely used to characterize
    temporal complexity in fMRI. In most fMRI studies, ApEn is reported
    only alongside other entropy-based measures — such as sample entropy
    (SE) or fuzzy approximate entropy — and therefore these applications
    are included in our “Comparisons of All Metrics” section. Two ApEn
    studies that do not appear in that section are M. O. Sokunbi et al.
    (<xref alt="2011" rid="ref-sokunbiInterindividualDifferencesFMRI2011" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)
    and C. Y. Liu et al.
    (<xref alt="2013" rid="ref-liuComplexitySynchronicityResting2013" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>);
    both report clinical findings that align with the broader complexity

        <p>Sample entropy (SE) was developed to correct ApEn’s limitations
    (<xref alt="Richman and Moorman 2000" rid="ref-richmanPhysiologicalTimeseriesAnalysis2000" ref-type="bibr">Richman

    SE and that of ApEn is that SE doesn’t count self-matches in the
    conditional probability, which corrects the two limitations
    described in the ApEn section

    found that SE discriminated between young and old adults in series
    as short as 85 in a small (n = 20) cohort. Again highlighting that
    length limitations are dataset-dependent, Moses O. Sokunbi
    (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-sokunbiSampleEntropyReveals2014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)
    found that more data points were needed in a larger (n = 86) cohort
    (potentially because the smaller cohort had low inter-individual
    variability).</p>

        <p>Several innovations to SE have been made in recent years. G. Del
    Mauro and Wang
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    introduced “cross” SE, a method for comparing multiple SE maps which
    can be applied to make comparisons between subjects, sessions, scan
    times, or regions. Thus far, cross entropy has been used to show a
    decoupling between the (across-subject) mean and variance of SE
    across different brain regions
    (<xref alt="G. Del Mauro and Wang 2024" rid="ref-delmauroCrosssubjectBrainEntropy2024" ref-type="bibr">G.
    Del Mauro and Wang 2024</xref>). Z. Wang
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    pioneered dynamic SE, wherein SE is estimated for every segment of a
    sliding window. Despite its name, dynamic SE is not designed to be
    used to track changes in SE over the course of a run; instead, SE
    for each segment is combined into a final run mean. In a sample of
    862 subjects, Z. Wang
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-wangNeurocognitiveCorrelatesBrain2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    found minimal differences between static (traditional) and dynamic
    SE.</p>

        <p>The entropy-based metrics discussed thus far — Shannon entropy,
    KS entropy, ApEn, and SE — are maximized with maximum randomness
    (<xref alt="Figure 11" rid="fig-entropymonotonic">Figure 11</xref>).
    That is, these metrics are formulated to increase monotonically with
    series randomness. Contrast this with the definition we described at
    the beginning, where complexity is a balance of regularity and
    irregularity, the “ideal” complexity metric should be maximized at
    an intermediate point these two extremes. Therefore, strictly
    speaking, despite being the most commonly used metrics, ApEn and SE
    do not truly capture “complexity.”</p>

        <p>How much of a limitation is this? We are reluctant to dismiss the
    breadth of good work that has already been completed; in our view,
    the conflation of complexity and irregularity is only a limitation
    if, at the scale under investigation, the comparison involves shifts
    past the midpoint from the domain of irregularity to that of
    regularity. Although we recognize the limitations of comparing
    across metrics, we observe that metrics that can describe the full
    irregularity–regularity range tend to regularity in the adult brain
    (e.g., avalanche
    (<xref alt="Xu, Feng, and Yu 2022" rid="ref-xuAvalancheCriticalityIndividuals2022" ref-type="bibr">Xu,

    Vanderwal, and Weber 2022</xref>); both described later in this
    review). Therefore, the distinction between complexity and
    irregularity may be only semantic, at least in the healthy adult
    brain (but perhaps not in other populations – e.g., infants
    (<xref alt="Mella et al. 2024" rid="ref-mellaTemporalComplexityBOLDsignal2024" ref-type="bibr">Mella
    et al. 2024</xref>)). Such distinctions could account for the
    observed inconsistencies across clinical studies, especially across
    neuroimaging modalities (see Discussion). In the next section, we
    will discuss a method to address this limitation: multiscale sample
    entropy (MSE).</p>

        <p>Is a single-scale, like the entropy metrics discussed above,
    sufficient to describe the brain? The brain is complex across a
    range of temporal scales, from very short time windows to very long
    ones, and understanding how these layers interact is essential to
    understanding the system as a whole

    high-frequency oscillations (i.e., patterns that recur at fine
    scales) interact with slow ones, allowing for information
    transmission
    (<xref alt="Canolty and Knight 2010" rid="ref-canoltyFunctionalRoleCrossfrequency2010" ref-type="bibr">Canolty

    to brain function
    (<xref alt="Werner 2010" rid="ref-wernerFractalsNervousSystem2010" ref-type="bibr">Werner
    2010</xref>). A better complexity metric would therefore have the
    ability to describe patterns that occur across multiple scales.</p>
        <p>MSE was developed to more fully characterize the complexity of
    physiological signals by describing SE over multiple scales

    C. Yang et al. 2013</xref>). This is achieved by downsampling the
    original time series to multiple lower temporal resolutions to
    create “new” series across a range of lower frequencies
    (<xref alt="Figure 12" rid="fig-downsampling">Figure 12</xref>). The
    SE algorithm is then applied to each series, resulting in a unique
    SE value for each temporal resolution. That is, the final output
    consists of a vector of SE values, one for each resolution. Because
    the output is not a single number, it can be hard to interpret.
    Typically, results are presented as a plot of SE versus sampling
    resolution
    (<xref alt="Figure 13" rid="fig-msescale">Figure 13</xref>). As an

        <p>Unlike single-scale entropy, MSE can differentiate randomness
    from complexity. The shape of the scale-MSE curve is
    neurophysiologically meaningful
    (<xref alt="Figure 13" rid="fig-msescale">Figure 13</xref>). MSE for
    white noise is high at short scales (where there are random
    fluctuations) and decreases at coarser scales, as fluctuations are
    smoothed out [McDonough and Nashiro
    (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>);
    hoComplexityAnalysisResting2017] (however, this may be due to bias;
    see Kosciessa, Kloosterman, and Garrett
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-kosciessaStandardMultiscaleEntropy2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)).
    Fully preprocessed cerebrospinal fluid signal, which in theory
    consists of a series of uncorrelated random observations and
    therefore approximates white noise, has a high-then-low MSE curve
    (<xref alt="McDonough and Nashiro 2014" rid="ref-mcdonoughNetworkComplexityMeasure2014" ref-type="bibr">McDonough
    and Nashiro 2014</xref>). On the other hand, complex signals, which
    contain meaningful information across scales, have approximately
    horizontal MSE curves. For instance, pink and brown noise — which,
    unlike white noise, contain autocorrelation (i.e., future values are
    influenced by past ones) — both have characteristic MSE curves
    (<xref alt="Figure 13" rid="fig-msescale">Figure 13</xref>), with
    pink noise, which contains more autocorrelation than brown, having
    the flatter curve [McDonough and Nashiro

    Consistent with the idea that BOLD signal from grey matter contains
    the more meaningful information, its MSE more closely resembles that
    of pink noise than that of white noise [McDonough and Nashiro

        <p>What are the limitations of MSE? MSE requires a long time series
    for proper computation and utilization. Series must be long enough
    such that the longest scale (e.g., lowest temporal resolution)
    produced through downsampling contains at least 80 timepoints
    (<xref alt="Moses O. Sokunbi 2014" rid="ref-sokunbiSampleEntropyReveals2014" ref-type="bibr">Moses
    O. Sokunbi 2014</xref>). Furthermore, for MSE to be most useful, the
    series must be long enough to support multiple resolutions of
    downsampling. Fortunately for fMRI researchers, Grandy et al.
    (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-grandyEstimationBrainSignal2016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
    showed that MSE can be effectively estimated across discontinuous
    segments (i.e., multiple runs of fMRI can be concatenated and the
    estimation will still be effective).</p>

          <p>Permutation entropy (PE) considers only the order of amplitude
      values, not absolute amplitudes
      (<xref alt="Bandt and Pompe 2002" rid="ref-bandtPermutationEntropyNatural2002" ref-type="bibr">Bandt
      and Pompe 2002</xref>). PE calculation uses a sliding window to
      slice the series into overlapping segments called “embedded
      vectors.” Each embedded vector is matched to a motif (called a
      “permutation pattern” or an “ordinal pattern”), which represents
      the relative order of the values in the vector. PE is the Shannon
      entropy of the relative frequencies of the ordinal patterns. That
      is, PE is closely related to Shannon entropy, but considers the
      order of values. Compared to ApEn and SE, PE is simpler to
      compute, makes fewer assumptions, and is more robust in the
      presence of noise

          <p>There are several variants of PE. PE can be computed on
      downsampled versions of the data (i.e., multiscale permutation
      entropy), resulting in a description of PE across frequencies

      and incorporates amplitude information into the PE calculation by
      multiplying each embedded vector by a weight. Unlike PE, wPE is
      affected by spikes and abrupt amplitude changes.</p>

    fractional Brownian motion.</bold> Raw simulated time-series with
    1,024 time-points and known Hurst values are plotted on the left.
    The top three time-series are fractional Gaussian noise, while the
    bottom three are fractional Brownian motion. H values are displayed
    on the left, while <inline-formula><alternatives><tex-math><![CDATA[\beta]]></tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>
    values are displayed on the right. Note how fractional Gaussian
    noise remain centered around a mean (i.e. stationary), while
    fractional Brownian motion wanders away from the mean
    (i.e. non-stationary). Log-log power spectral density plots of the
    signals on the left are shown on the right. Linear-regression fits
    are shown in red, which are used to calculate

    time-series were created using the Davies-Harte method. Figure
